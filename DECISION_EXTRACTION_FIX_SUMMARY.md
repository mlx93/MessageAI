# Decision Extraction - Fix Summary ✅

## Status: DEPLOYED (Oct 25, 2025)

## Problems Fixed

### 1. Backend Using Wrong Field Names ❌ → ✅

**Issue:** Backend code was looking for fields that don't exist in Firestore
- Looking for `participantProfiles` but Firestore has `participantDetails`
- Looking for `sender` but messages use `senderId`

**Result:** 
- All participants showed "No profile for {uid}, using fallback"
- All messages filtered out: "No messages in conversation"
- Zero decisions extracted

**Fix Applied:**
```typescript
// Line 89: Changed participantProfiles → participantDetails
const participantDetails = convData.participantDetails || {};

// Line 154: Changed sender → senderId
data.senderId && typeof data.senderId === "string"

// Line 162: Map senderId to sender field for processing
sender: data.senderId as string,
```

### 2. Existing Decisions Have Bad Data ❌

**Issue:** Old decisions have:
- `participants: ["undefined"]` 
- `messageIds: ["8", "51"]` (array indices, not real IDs)

**Result:** Frontend filters out all 14 existing decisions

**Fix:** Backend now extracts proper participant names, new decisions will be correct

### 3. TypeScript Linting Warnings ⚠️ → ✅

**Issue:** 3 warnings about `any` type usage

**Fix Applied:**
```typescript
// Changed all `any` to `unknown` with proper type assertions
.filter((uid: unknown) => uid && typeof uid === "string")
catch (error: unknown) { const err = error as Error & {...} }
```

## Files Changed

- `/functions/src/ai/decisionTracking.ts` (lines 89, 91, 154, 162, 180, 243, 345)

## Verification Steps

1. ✅ Firebase functions deployed successfully
2. ⏳ Test "Analyze Conversations" in app
3. ⏳ Check Firebase logs for participant names (should see "Myles L", "Dan G", etc.)
4. ⏳ Check Firebase logs for message count (should see 10+ messages per conversation)
5. ⏳ Verify new decisions appear in frontend with real names

## Expected Outcome

**Before:**
```
Analysis Complete
Found 0 new decisions from the last 7 days. (15 conversations skipped)
```

**After:**
```
Analysis Complete
Found 3-5 new decisions from the last 7 days. (0 conversations skipped)
```

## Debug Script Created

`/scripts/debug-decisions.ts` - Can be run anytime to inspect:
- Existing decisions in Firestore
- Conversation structure (participantDetails)
- Message data structure (senderId, timestamp, text)

Run with: `npx tsx scripts/debug-decisions.ts`
