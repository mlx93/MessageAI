# Firestore Index Building Status

## Current Status
The Firestore composite indexes for AI features have been deployed and are currently **building** on Firebase's servers.

## Why This Happens
When you deploy new Firestore indexes to a project that already has data:
- Firebase needs time to build the indexes by scanning existing documents
- Build time varies based on the amount of data (usually minutes to hours)
- During this time, queries that use these indexes will fail with `failed-precondition` errors

## What We've Done
1. ✅ Deployed all required composite indexes for AI features
2. ✅ Added error handling to gracefully handle index-building errors
3. ✅ Fixed the Reanimated worklet error
4. ✅ App now loads conversations without crashing

## Affected Features (Temporarily Unavailable)
While indexes are building, these AI features won't load data:
- Proactive AI suggestions in chat screens
- Action items filtering and display
- Decisions tracking and display

## Monitoring Index Build Progress

### Option 1: Firebase Console (Recommended)
Visit the Firebase Console to see index status:
```
https://console.firebase.google.com/project/messageai-mlx93/firestore/indexes
```

### Option 2: Command Line
```bash
firebase firestore:indexes
```

### Option 3: Check the Error Link
The error message includes a direct link to check the specific index status:
```
https://console.firebase.google.com/v1/r/project/messageai-mlx93/firestore/indexes
```

## When Will It Be Ready?
- **Small datasets** (< 1000 documents): Usually 5-15 minutes
- **Medium datasets** (1000-10,000 documents): Usually 15-60 minutes
- **Large datasets** (> 10,000 documents): Can take several hours

## What Happens After Indexes Are Built?
Once the indexes are ready:
1. The app will automatically start working with AI features
2. No code changes or redeployment needed
3. The error handling we added will stop triggering
4. All AI features (suggestions, action items, decisions) will be available

## Current Error Handling
The app now gracefully handles index-building errors:
- No crash or error popups
- Just a console log: `⏳ AI indexes are building, suggestions will be available soon`
- App continues to function normally for all other features

## Testing After Indexes Are Built
Once indexes are ready, test these features:
1. Open a conversation - should load without errors
2. Check for proactive AI suggestions
3. Try the summarize button (✨)
4. Verify action items and priority badges appear

## Notes
- The main app functionality (messaging, contacts, presence) works fine
- Only AI-specific features are affected during index building
- This is a one-time process per index deployment
