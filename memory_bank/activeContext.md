# Active Context

**Date:** Oct 24, 2025
**State:** MVP complete + AI enhancements complete; productionâ€‘ready with advanced AI features.

## Current focus
- **AI Features Complete**: Full AI assistant (Ava) implementation with RAG pipeline, proactive triggers, enhanced error handling, and cache optimization.
- **Chat Integration**: Summarize button, priority badges, action items banner, proactive suggestion cards, thread summary modal.
- **Backend AI**: Enhanced proactive triggers, cache maintenance, migration scripts for existing messages.
- **Stability Maintained**: All previous stability improvements preserved (image flicker eliminated, scroll stability, offline queue).

## AI Enhancements Implemented
- **Chat Screen AI**: Summarize button (âœ¨), priority badges (ðŸ”´ðŸŸ¡), action items banner, proactive suggestions
- **RAG Pipeline**: Pinecone vector search with OpenAI embeddings for existing messages
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Offline detection, rate limiting, timeout management, user-friendly messages
- **Proactive Triggers**: 5 new trigger types (deadline conflicts, decision conflicts, overdue actions, context gaps)
- **Cache Optimization**: Longer TTLs, request batching, smart invalidation, scheduled cleanup

## Recent fixes
- **Firestore Index Error**: Fixed missing composite indexes for AI queries (action_items, decisions, proactive_suggestions)
- **Index Deployment**: Successfully deployed all required Firestore indexes (currently building on Firebase servers)
- **Reanimated Worklet Error**: Fixed shared value modification in worklet by removing blueBubblesTranslateX from useMemo dependency array
- **Index Building Error Handling**: Added graceful error handling for AI subscriptions while indexes are building

## Next steps
- Deploy AI functions to Firebase: `firebase deploy --only functions`
- Run message embedding migration: `npm run embed-messages`
- Test AI features in dev/prod builds
- Optional: Voice commands, smart notifications, meeting insights

## Guardrails (do not regress)
- Keep lastMessageId guard and 300ms debounce paths intact (chat, queue, retry).
- Preserve chat render stability patterns (no reanimated entering on images; stable callbacks; placeholders then enable images).
- Maintain offline queueâ€‘first and timeoutâ€‘protected sends.
- **AI Error Handling**: All AI methods wrapped with error handling; graceful offline degradation.
