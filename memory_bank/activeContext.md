# Active Context

**Date:** Oct 24, 2025
**State:** MVP complete + AI enhancements temporarily disabled while Firestore indexes build.

## Current focus
- **AI Features Temporarily Disabled**: All AI features commented out while Firestore indexes build (5-15 minutes)
- **Core App Fully Functional**: All messaging, contacts, presence, and offline features working perfectly
- **Index Building**: Firestore composite indexes deployed and currently building on Firebase servers
- **Stability Maintained**: All previous stability improvements preserved (image flicker eliminated, scroll stability, offline queue)

## AI Enhancements Implemented
- **Chat Screen AI**: Summarize button (âœ¨), priority badges (ðŸ”´ðŸŸ¡), action items banner, proactive suggestions
- **RAG Pipeline**: Pinecone vector search with OpenAI embeddings for existing messages
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Offline detection, rate limiting, timeout management, user-friendly messages
- **Proactive Triggers**: 5 new trigger types (deadline conflicts, decision conflicts, overdue actions, context gaps)
- **Cache Optimization**: Longer TTLs, request batching, smart invalidation, scheduled cleanup

## Recent fixes (Latest Git Commit: 452f9e8)
- **Firestore Index Error**: Fixed missing composite indexes for AI queries (action_items, decisions, proactive_suggestions)
- **Index Deployment**: Successfully deployed all required Firestore indexes (currently building on Firebase servers)
- **Reanimated Worklet Error**: Fixed shared value modification in worklet by removing blueBubblesTranslateX from useMemo dependency array
- **AI Features Temporarily Disabled**: Commented out all AI features in chat screen to prevent index building errors
- **Clear Code Markers**: Added `// TEMPORARILY DISABLED:` markers for easy re-enabling
- **Documentation**: Created comprehensive guides for re-enabling AI features

## Next steps (Priority Order)
1. **Wait for Index Building** (5-15 minutes): Monitor at https://console.firebase.google.com/project/messageai-mlx93/firestore/indexes
2. **Re-enable AI Features**: Uncomment all `// TEMPORARILY DISABLED:` sections in `app/chat/[id].tsx`
3. **Deploy AI functions**: `firebase deploy --only functions`
4. **Run message embedding**: `npm run embed-messages`
5. **Test AI features**: Verify all AI functionality works after re-enabling
6. **Optional**: Voice commands, smart notifications, meeting insights

## Guardrails (do not regress)
- Keep lastMessageId guard and 300ms debounce paths intact (chat, queue, retry).
- Preserve chat render stability patterns (no reanimated entering on images; stable callbacks; placeholders then enable images).
- Maintain offline queueâ€‘first and timeoutâ€‘protected sends.
- **AI Error Handling**: All AI methods wrapped with error handling; graceful offline degradation.
