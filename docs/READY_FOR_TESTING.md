## 🧪 Testing Guide

### Current State
**Logged In As:** Bob Boylan  
**Device:** iPhone 17 Pro Simulator  
**Features Available:** All Part 2 features ready

### What to Test Now

#### 1. Presence System ✅
**Expected behavior:**
- Bob should show as "Online" in other users' conversation lists
- Green dot should appear on Bob's avatar
- When Bob backgrounds the app, status should update

**How to test:**
1. Open Android emulator (press `a` in terminal)
2. Log in as a different user
3. Start a conversation with Bob
4. You should see Bob as "Online" with green dot
5. Check chat header for "Online" status

#### 2. Typing Indicators ✅
**Expected behavior:**
- When typing, other user sees "Bob Boylan is typing..."
- Indicator disappears 500ms after stopping

**How to test:**
1. In a conversation on Bob's device, start typing
2. On other device, you should see typing indicator
3. Stop typing, indicator should vanish

#### 3. Image Upload ✅
**Expected behavior:**
- Tap 📷 button
- Select image
- Image compresses if > 5MB
- Uploads to Cloud Storage
- Displays as 200x200 thumbnail

**How to test:**
1. Open any conversation
2. Tap image button (left of input)
3. Drag an image into simulator
4. Select it
5. Watch loading spinner
6. Image should appear in chat

#### 4. Push Notifications ✅
**Expected behavior:**
- When Bob's app is backgrounded, incoming messages trigger notifications
- When Bob is viewing a chat, no notification for that chat
- Tapping notification opens correct conversation

**How to test:**
1. Background Bob's app (Cmd+Shift+H)
2. Send message from another device
3. Check Firebase Console Functions logs
4. Notification should be sent (check logs)

**Note:** Expo Go has limitations with push notifications. For full testing:
- Notifications work in development
- Full functionality requires development build

#### 5. Real-Time Features ✅
All real-time features should work:
- Message delivery < 1 second
- Presence updates instantly
- Typing indicators appear immediately
- Read receipts update

## 📊 Firebase Console Monitoring

### Check Cloud Functions
**URL:** https://console.firebase.google.com/project/messageai-mlx93/functions

**What to monitor:**
1. **Invocations:** Should increase when messages are sent
2. **Execution time:** Should be under 5 seconds
3. **Errors:** Should be 0 (check logs if any)

**View Logs:**
```bash
firebase functions:log --only sendMessageNotification
```

Expected log entries when message is sent:
```
New message {messageId} in conversation {conversationId}
Recipients: user2, user3
Users to notify: user2
Sending notification to user2: Bob Boylan
Notification 1 sent
Sent 1 notifications
```

### Check Firestore
**URL:** https://console.firebase.google.com/project/messageai-mlx93/firestore

**Collections to monitor:**
1. **users** - Bob's document should have:
   - `online: true`
   - `lastSeen: [current timestamp]`
   - `fcmToken: [Expo push token]`

2. **activeConversations** - When Bob views a chat:
   - Document: Bob's UID
   - Fields: `conversationId`, `lastActive`

3. **conversations/{id}/typing** - When Bob types:
   - Document: Bob's UID
   - Fields: `isTyping: true`, `displayName: "Bob Boylan"`

4. **conversations/{id}/messages** - New messages:
   - All message fields present
   - `readBy` array includes Bob's UID
   - `deliveredTo` array gets updated

## 🎮 Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Two-Device Real-Time Chat

**Setup:**
1. Bob on iOS Simulator (already running)
2. Second user on Android Emulator

**Steps:**
```bash
# In terminal where Expo is running, press 'a'
# This opens Android emulator
```

3. Register/login as different user (e.g., "Alice")
4. Start conversation with Bob
5. Send messages back and forth

**Expected:**
- Messages appear in < 1 second
- Typing indicators work both ways
- Presence shows both as "Online"
- Read receipts update correctly

### Scenario 2: Image Sharing

**Steps:**
1. In conversation, tap 📷 button
2. Drag test image into simulator
3. Select image
4. Wait for upload
5. Image should appear in chat

**Check Firebase Storage:**
- Navigate to Storage in Firebase Console
- Should see: `images/{conversationId}/{timestamp}.jpg`
- File size should be reasonable (< 5MB)

### Scenario 3: Offline/Online Presence

**Steps:**
1. Bob is online (green dot visible to other user)
2. Background Bob's app (Cmd+Shift+H)
3. Other user should see "Last seen just now"
4. Bring Bob back
5. Other user should see "Online" again

### Scenario 4: Smart Notifications

**Setup:**
1. Bob viewing conversation with Alice
2. Alice sends message
3. Bob should NOT get notification (already viewing)

**Then:**
1. Bob exits conversation (back button)
2. Alice sends another message
3. Bob SHOULD get notification

**Check:**
- View Cloud Function logs
- Should see: "User {Bob's UID} is actively viewing conversation"
- Then: "Users to notify: []" (empty when Bob is viewing)
- Then: "Users to notify: {Bob's UID}" (when Bob exits)

### Scenario 5: Group Chat

**Setup:**
1. Create group with 3 users (need 3rd simulator/device)
2. Send message from one user

**Expected:**
- All users receive message
- Typing shows individual names
- Notifications sent to inactive users only

## 📈 Performance Expectations

### Message Delivery
- **Target:** < 1 second
- **Acceptable:** < 2 seconds
- **Action if slower:** Check network, Firebase region

### Image Upload
- **Small images (< 1MB):** 2-5 seconds
- **Large images (> 5MB):** 5-10 seconds (with compression)
- **Action if slower:** Check network, compression settings

### Presence Updates
- **Target:** Instant
- **Acceptable:** < 2 seconds
- **Action if slower:** Check onSnapshot listeners

### Typing Indicators
- **Appears:** Instantly when typing starts
- **Disappears:** 500ms after typing stops
- **Action if issues:** Check typing collection in Firestore

## 🐛 Known Limitations

### Expo Go Notifications
**Warning seen in logs:**
```
WARN  expo-notifications: Android Push notifications... not fully supported in Expo Go
```

**Impact:**
- Push notifications work but with limitations
- Full functionality requires development build
- For MVP testing, this is acceptable

**Workaround for full testing:**
1. Build development client:
   ```bash
   npx expo run:ios
   npx expo run:android
   ```

### Presence Detection
- Uses manual online/offline tracking
- ~1 minute delay for disconnect detection
- Real-time Database would be more accurate

### First Load
- First time opening app may take 3-5 seconds
- Subsequent opens should be instant (SQLite cache)

## 🔍 Debugging Tips

### Messages Not Sending
1. Check network connection
2. Check Firestore rules (should be deployed)
3. Check console for errors
4. Verify user is authenticated

### Images Not Uploading
1. Check Storage rules
2. Check file size (< 10MB)
3. Check permissions (photo library access)
4. Check Firebase Storage console

### Notifications Not Working
1. Check Cloud Function logs
2. Verify FCM token in user document
3. Check activeConversations collection
4. Remember: Expo Go has limitations

### Presence Not Updating
1. Check user document in Firestore
2. Verify AuthContext is calling setUserOnline
3. Check onSnapshot subscriptions
4. Refresh the app
