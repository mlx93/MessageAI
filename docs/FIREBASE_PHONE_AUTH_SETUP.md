## 📱 **How Phone Auth Works**

### Development (Testing)

**Good News:** Phone auth works in simulators/emulators for testing!

Firebase provides **test phone numbers** you can use:

1. In Firebase Console → Authentication → Sign-in method
2. Scroll to "Phone" section
3. Click "Phone numbers for testing"
4. Add test numbers:

```
+1 650-555-1234  →  Code: 123456
+1 650-555-5678  →  Code: 654321
+1 650-555-9999  →  Code: 999999
```

These numbers:
- ✅ Work instantly (no SMS sent)
- ✅ Always use the same verification code
- ✅ Free (no SMS charges)
- ✅ Perfect for development

### Production (Real Users)

For real phone numbers:
- Firebase sends SMS with 6-digit code
- **Cost:** $0.01 per verification
- **Limit:** 10 SMS/day on free plan (Spark)
- **Blaze plan:** Unlimited SMS

---

## 🔐 **reCAPTCHA Configuration**

Phone auth requires reCAPTCHA for security. This is automatic for:
- ✅ iOS apps (uses APNS)
- ✅ Android apps (uses SafetyNet)
- ⚠️ Web (needs configuration)

**For now:** Since you're building iOS/Android, no additional setup needed!

## 🧪 **Testing Strategy**

### Phase 1: Use Test Numbers (Now)
```
Phone: +1 650-555-1234
Code: 123456
```
Perfect for development and testing.

### Phase 2: Use Real Numbers (Production)
```
Phone: Your actual phone
Code: SMS received
```
Test with your real phone number before launch.
