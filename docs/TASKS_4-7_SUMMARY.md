## 🔧 Technical Highlights

### Architecture Patterns
- **Service Layer**: All Firebase logic isolated
- **Offline-First**: SQLite cache + AsyncStorage queue
- **Optimistic UI**: Messages appear instantly
- **Real-Time Sync**: Firestore onSnapshot listeners
- **Deterministic IDs**: Direct conversations use sorted participant IDs
- **Batch Queries**: Handle Firestore 'in' limit of 10

### Performance Optimizations
- Cached messages load instantly (no network wait)
- Batch phone number matching (10 at a time)
- Efficient Firestore indexes
- Smart retry logic prevents server overload
- Message caching on-the-fly

### Error Handling
- Try-catch blocks throughout
- User-friendly error alerts
- Network status monitoring
- Graceful degradation when offline
- Failed message retry mechanism

## 🚨 CRITICAL: Before Testing

### 1. Deploy Firestore Security Rules (REQUIRED)
```bash
# Open Firebase Console → Firestore → Rules
# Copy rules from docs/FIRESTORE_SETUP.md
# Click "Publish"
```

**Why:** Without rules:
- Email/phone uniqueness NOT enforced
- Anyone can read/write any data
- Security vulnerabilities

### 2. Create Firestore Indexes (REQUIRED)
**Option A (Recommended):** Auto-create when app runs
1. Run app and navigate to conversations/chat
2. Look for console errors with index creation links
3. Click links to create indexes
4. Wait 2-5 minutes for indexes to build

**Option B:** Manual creation
1. Firebase Console → Firestore → Indexes
2. Create indexes from `docs/FIRESTORE_SETUP.md`
3. Wait for build completion

**Required Indexes:**
- Conversations: `participants` + `updatedAt`
- Messages: `conversationId` + `timestamp`
- Typing (later): `conversationId` + `isTyping`

---

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### Manual Testing (Required Before Moving On)
```bash
# Start the app
npm start

# Press 'i' for iOS Simulator
# Press 'a' for Android Emulator
```

**Test Scenarios:**
- [ ] Register 2 users (one on each platform)
- [ ] Import contacts (may need to add test contacts)
- [ ] Search by phone number
- [ ] Start conversation from contacts
- [ ] Send messages back and forth
- [ ] Verify real-time delivery (< 1 second)
- [ ] Enable airplane mode → send message → disable → verify delivery
- [ ] Force quit app → reopen → verify messages persist
- [ ] Add 3rd participant → verify conversation becomes group
- [ ] Send messages in group → verify all receive

### Unit Testing
```bash
npm test
```

Expected: All tests pass (basic tests created)

## 🐛 Known Issues

### High Priority (Fix Before Moving On)
1. **Firestore Rules Not Deployed** → Action required
2. **Firestore Indexes Not Created** → Action required

### Medium Priority (Can Wait)
3. **Unread Count Not Functional** → Placeholder only
4. **Social Auth Deferred** → Works in production builds only

### Low Priority (Post-MVP)
5. **Phone-First Auth** → Plan in `docs/PHONE_AUTH_PRIORITY_PLAN.md`
