# Quick MVP Status & Decision

**Date:** October 21, 2025  
**Time Spent on Auth:** 3+ hours  
**Decision:** Move forward with email/password only

---

## üì∏ What I See from Your Screenshots

### 1. Apple Sign-In ‚úÖ EXPECTED BEHAVIOR
- Shows informative alert explaining it won't work in Expo Go
- This is CORRECT - Apple Sign-In requires development build
- **Action:** Use "OK" to dismiss, don't use Apple Sign-In for MVP

### 2. Google Sign-In ‚ùå Still 404
- Getting "The requested URL was not found on this server"
- Needs Google Cloud Console configuration
- Would take 30-60 more minutes to fix

### 3. Profile Display Issue üêõ
- Your logs show profile loaded correctly:
  ```
  firstName: "Jodie"
  lastName: "Davidson"  
  email: "Jodiedavidson92@gmail.com"
  ```
- But UI shows "Hello, User!" and "No email"
- This is a display bug I'm investigating

### 4. Edit Profile Button
- Goes to `/auth/complete-profile` which doesn't exist yet
- That page is not part of initial auth (it's for profile updates later)

## üí° RECOMMENDATION: Skip Social Auth for MVP

### Why?
1. **Email/Password Works:** You successfully registered Jodie Davidson!
2. **Time Investment:** Already spent 3+ hours on social auth
3. **MVP Goal:** Test messaging features, not authentication
4. **Production Will Work:** Social auth works in development builds

### What Works Now:
- ‚úÖ Email/Password registration
- ‚úÖ Email/Password login
- ‚úÖ Profile creation in Firestore
- ‚úÖ Sign out
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Profile display (investigating)

---

## üîß Immediate Actions

### 1. Fix Profile Display Bug (5 minutes)
Let me check why it's showing "Hello, User!" when data is loaded.

**In simulator, reload app:**
- Press `Cmd + D`
- Tap "Reload"
- Check console logs for new debug info

### 2. Test Email/Password Flow
1. Sign out
2. Try logging in again with: Jodiedavidson92@gmail.com
3. Should navigate to Chats screen
4. Check if profile displays correctly

### 3. Remove Edit Profile Button (For Now)
Since that page doesn't exist, let's remove it to avoid confusion.

## üéØ MVP Path Forward

### Option A: Continue with Email/Password (RECOMMENDED)
**Time:** Immediate  
**Steps:**
1. Fix profile display bug (investigating now)
2. Continue to Hour 3-4: Contact Management
3. Test social auth later in production build

**Benefits:**
- No more auth debugging
- Focus on core features
- Can add more test users easily

### Option B: Fix Google OAuth First
**Time:** 30-60 minutes  
**Steps:**
1. Access Google Cloud Console
2. Add redirect URIs
3. Test again
4. Debug any new issues

**Risks:**
- More time on non-core features
- Might hit more issues
- Still won't fix Apple (needs dev build)

## üìä Time Spent vs Value

| Feature | Time Spent | MVP Value | Status |
|---------|-----------|-----------|---------|
| Email/Password | 2 hours | HIGH ‚úÖ | Working |
| Google Sign-In | 1+ hours | LOW ‚ö†Ô∏è | Not working |
| Apple Sign-In | 30 min | LOW ‚ö†Ô∏è | Can't work in Expo Go |
| **Total Auth Time** | **3.5+ hours** | | |

**Core Messaging** (0 hours so far) | **CRITICAL** ‚ùó

---

## ‚úÖ My Recommendation

### 1. Fix Profile Display (Now)
Let me figure out why "Hello, User!" appears

### 2. Skip Social Auth (For MVP)
- Use email/password for testing
- Test social auth in production build later
- Save 1-2 hours of debugging

### 3. Move to Hour 3-4 (Next)
- Contact management
- Conversation creation
- Start building actual messaging features

---

## üêõ Profile Display Debug

Looking at your logs, the data IS there:
```json
{
  "firstName": "Jodie",
  "lastName": "Davidson",
  "email": "Jodiedavidson92@gmail.com"
}
```

But UI shows fallback values. Possible causes:
1. Data type mismatch
2. Component re-render timing
3. Firestore timestamp conversion issue

**Next:** Reload app and check new debug logs I added

---

## üéØ Decision Point

**Choose one:**

### A) Fix Profile Display & Continue MVP ‚≠ê RECOMMENDED
- ‚úÖ Quick fix (5-10 min)
- ‚úÖ Move to contacts/messaging
- ‚úÖ Test social auth in production

### B) Keep Debugging Social Auth
- ‚è∞ Another 1-2 hours
- ‚ö†Ô∏è May hit more issues
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Delays core features
