**Status:** ✅ All 9 Tasks Complete

## Overview
Comprehensive UX overhaul transforming MessageAI (now **aiMessage**) into a professional, Apple-quality messaging app with all critical features and refinements.

---

## ✅ All Improvements Complete (9/9)

### 1. Apple-Style Edit Profile with Inline Editing ✅
**Issue:** Profile modal had cramped inline editing, labels mixed with values.

**Solution:** Complete redesign matching iOS Contacts app:

**Edit Mode:**
- Labels ABOVE inputs (capitalized, grey)
- Clean white input fields with rounded corners
- Read-only phone field (grey background)
- Auto-focus on first input when tapping "Edit"
- Keyboard appears immediately

**View Mode:**
- Values only, NO labels
- Each field is clickable to enter edit mode
- Clean, minimal design
- Phone number in grey (read-only visual indicator)

**Files Modified:**
- `app/(tabs)/index.tsx`
  - Separate `appleEditFieldsContainer` and `appleViewFieldsContainer`
  - TouchableOpacity wrappers on view fields
  - `autoFocus={true}` on first input
  - New styles: `appleEditFieldGroup`, `appleEditFieldLabel`, `appleEditFieldInput`, `appleReadOnlyField`, `appleViewFieldRow`, `appleViewFieldValue`, `appleViewFieldReadOnly`

**Impact:** Professional iOS-style profile management that users instinctively understand.

---

### 2. Read Receipts Right-Adjusted ✅
**Issue:** Read receipts were centered under blue bubbles per previous request.

**Refinement:** User requested right-adjusted positioning instead.

**Solution:** Changed `readReceiptOwn` style:
- `textAlign: 'right'`
- `alignSelf: 'flex-end'`
- Maintains `marginRight: 8` to match bubble margin

**Files Modified:**
- `app/chat/[id].tsx` - Updated `readReceiptOwn` styles

**Impact:** Read receipts properly aligned under blue bubbles.

---

### 3. Existing Participants in Group Edit Mode ✅
**Issue:** When adding users to group chat, existing participants weren't shown, couldn't remove participants.

**Solution:** Complete group management redesign:

**Features:**
- **Show ALL participants** (existing + pending) in pill bar
- **Existing participants:** Grey pills, tap × to mark for removal
- **Marked for removal:** Light red background, strikethrough text
- **Pending additions:** Light blue pills, tap × to unmark
- **Tap checkmark:** Commits all changes (removals + additions)
- **Tap X (no changes):** Cancels edit mode
- **Tap message area:** Also cancels (closes edit mode)

**Implementation:**
- Added `participantsToRemove` state
- Added `handleRemoveExistingParticipant` function
- Updated `handleConfirmAddUsers` to process removals first, then additions
- Added `removeParticipantFromConversation` import
- Added styles: `participantPillRemoving`, `participantPillTextRemoving`, `participantPillPending`
- Wrapped messages in `TouchableWithoutFeedback` to cancel on tap

**Files Modified:**
- `app/chat/[id].tsx`
  - Added removal logic
  - Visual feedback for removal state
  - Cancel on message panel tap

**Impact:** Full control over group membership matching iMessage UX.

---

### 4. Fixed "New Message" Page Header ✅
**Issue:** Still showed "(tabs)" text on iPhone.

**Solution:** Added `headerBackTitle: ''` to root layout configuration.

**Files Modified:**
- `app/_layout.tsx` - Added `headerBackTitle: ''` to new-message screen

**Impact:** Clean header with no unwanted text.

---

### 5. Contacts Search Across All App Users ✅
**Issue:** Search only worked on imported contacts, not all app users.

**Solution:** Complete search overhaul matching "New aiMessage" functionality:

**Features:**
- **Real-time search** across ALL aiMessage users
- **Fuzzy matching** on name and phone number
- **Debounced** (300ms) for performance
- **Loading indicator** during search
- **Clear button** when typing
- **Fallback** to local filtering if search fails

**Implementation:**
- Uses `searchAllUsers` from contactService
- Maps results to Contact format
- Shows loading spinner while searching
- iOS-style search bar with icons

**Files Modified:**
- `app/(tabs)/contacts.tsx`
  - Added `isSearching` state
  - Updated search useEffect to use `searchAllUsers`
  - Added ActivityIndicator
  - Added `searchLoading` style

**Impact:** Users can find ANY aiMessage user, not just their imported contacts.

---

### 6. Renamed to "aiMessage" ✅
**Issue:** App was called "New iMessage" instead of "aiMessage".

**Solution:** Updated title to "New aiMessage" (added 'a' prefix).

**Files Modified:**
- `app/new-message.tsx` - Changed `title: 'New aiMessage'`

**Impact:** Proper branding throughout the app.

---

### 7. Per-User Conversation Deletion ✅
**Issue:** Deleting a conversation deleted it for ALL participants globally.

**Solution:** Implemented per-user deletion with `deletedBy` array:

**Architecture:**
- **New field:** `deletedBy?: string[]` in Conversation type
- **Delete action:** Adds user UID to `deletedBy` array (doesn't delete document)
- **Filtering:** `getUserConversations` filters out conversations where user is in `deletedBy`
- **Preserves data:** Messages and conversation remain for other participants

**Benefits:**
- Each user has their own view of conversations
- Deleting for yourself doesn't affect others
- Data preserved for legal/archival purposes
- Can be "undeleted" in future (just remove from array)

**Files Modified:**
- `types/index.ts` - Added `deletedBy?: string[]` to Conversation interface
- `services/conversationService.ts`
  - Imported `updateDoc`, `arrayUnion`
  - Modified `deleteConversation` to use `arrayUnion(userId)` instead of `deleteDoc`
  - Modified `getUserConversations` to filter out deleted conversations
- `firestore.rules` - Already allows this (participants can update)

**Impact:** Professional, per-user conversation management matching industry standards.

---

### 8. Blue Message Bubble Spacing ✅
**Issue:** Blue bubbles touched right edge of screen.

**Solution:** Added `marginRight: 8` to `ownMessage` style.

**Files Modified:**
- `app/chat/[id].tsx` - Updated `ownMessage` style

**Impact:** Bubbles have breathing room, matching iMessage.

---

### 9. Additional Polish & Fixes ✅

**Centered Header Icons:**
- Add/checkmark/X icons now centered in 32x32 touch targets
- Files: `app/chat/[id].tsx` - Updated navigation header styles

**Optimized Timestamp Spacing:**
- Reduced reveal container from 100px to 80px
- Timestamps flush with edge when revealed
- Files: `app/chat/[id].tsx` - Updated `timestampRevealContainer`

**Messages Header Spacing:**
- Increased header height to 120 for more top padding
- Files: `app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx` - Added `headerStyle: { height: 120 }`
