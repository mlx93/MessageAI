# Profile Completion Feature

## Overview
Added profile completion flow to handle users with incomplete profiles, including:
- Existing users from before all fields were required
- Future social auth users (Google/Apple) who may not have phone numbers
- Users who need to update their information

---

## What Was Added

### 1. Complete Profile Screen
**File**: `app/auth/complete-profile.tsx`

**Features:**
- âœ… Pre-fills existing data
- âœ… Highlights missing required fields (orange border)
- âœ… Validates phone numbers (min 10 digits)
- âœ… Updates displayName and initials automatically
- âœ… "Skip for now" option for users with partial data
- âœ… Prevents empty/whitespace-only submissions

**Required Fields:**
- First Name
- Last Name
- Phone Number

### 2. Profile Validation Helper
**File**: `services/authService.ts`

**New Function:**
```typescript
isProfileComplete(profile: User | null): boolean
```

Checks if a profile has all required fields:
- firstName (non-empty)
- lastName (non-empty)
- phoneNumber (non-empty)

### 3. Updated Routing Logic
**File**: `app/index.tsx`

**New Flow:**
```
Login â†’ Check Auth State â†’ Check Profile Completeness
         â†“                   â†“
    Not Logged In        Complete?
         â†“                   â†“
    Login Screen        Yes â†’ Tabs
                        No â†’ Complete Profile
```

### 4. Edit Profile Button
**File**: `app/(tabs)/index.tsx`

Added "Edit Profile" button to main chats screen so users can update their information anytime.

## Implementation Details

### Phone Number Normalization
Phone numbers are automatically normalized to E.164 format:
- Input: `(555) 123-4567` or `555-123-4567` or `5551234567`
- Stored: `+15551234567`

This happens in `updateUserProfile()` via the existing `normalizePhoneNumber()` function.

### Data Updates
Profile updates use Firestore's `merge: true` option:
```typescript
await setDoc(doc(db, 'users', uid), updates, { merge: true });
```

This means:
- Only specified fields are updated
- Other fields remain unchanged
- No data loss risk

### Auto-Generated Fields
When updating name fields, these are automatically updated:
- `displayName`: `"${firstName} ${lastName}"`
- `initials`: `"${firstName[0]}${lastName[0]}".toUpperCase()`

Example:
- Input: firstName="John", lastName="Doe"
- Generated: displayName="John Doe", initials="JD"

## UI/UX Details

### Visual Indicators
- **Missing fields**: Orange border + light orange background
- **Complete fields**: Standard gray border
- **Loading state**: Spinner on Save button
- **Disabled state**: Buttons disabled during save

### Validation Messages
- Empty fields: "Please complete: First Name, Last Name, Phone Number"
- Invalid phone: "Please enter a valid phone number (at least 10 digits)"
- Save success: "Your profile has been completed successfully!"

### Skip Option
Users with some profile data can skip for now and complete later via "Edit Profile" button. This prevents blocking access to the app for users who want to explore first.

## Database Impact

### Firestore Updates
All profile updates write to the `users/{uid}` document:
```javascript
{
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe",
  displayName: "John Doe",
  initials: "JD",
  phoneNumber: "+15551234567",
  // ... other fields remain unchanged
}
```

### No New Collections
This feature doesn't create new collections or indexes. It only updates existing user documents.
