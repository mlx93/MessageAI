## 🎯 Project Overview

I'm implementing AI features for my MessageAI messaging app (React Native + Expo SDK 54 with Firebase backend). I need to add **5 required AI features plus a Proactive Assistant** using a **Firebase-only architecture** with OpenAI GPT-4o/4o-mini, Pinecone for RAG, and AI SDK by Vercel.

## ✅ Current Status
- ✅ MVP messaging app is complete and production-ready
- ✅ Real-time messaging with offline-first architecture and SQLite caching  
- ✅ OpenAI API key ready
- ✅ Firebase backend configured
- 🎯 **Goal**: Add AI features using simplified Firebase-only architecture (no AWS Lambda)

## 📚 Required Documentation Review

**⭐ PRIMARY GUIDE:**
- `@CURSOR_MESSAGEAI_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` - Our 3-week Firebase-only implementation plan

**📋 SUPPORTING DOCS:**
- `@messageai-technical-spec.md` - Complete TypeScript interfaces, Firestore schemas, API contracts (v2.0 - Firebase-only)
- `@messageai-architecture.md` - System architecture and technology decisions (v2.0)  
- `@messageai-persona-prd.md` - Product requirements for Remote Team Professional persona

## 🚀 Implementation Plan

I want to start implementing in this order:
1. **Setup Phase**: Pinecone account, index creation, API keys in Firebase
2. **Utility Files**: Create openai.ts, pinecone.ts, cache.ts utilities
3. **First Feature**: Priority Detection (Feature 4) as our starting point
4. **Step-by-step guidance**: Show me exactly what code to write and where

## ✅ Features to Implement

**5 Required Features:**
1. Thread Summarization
2. Action Item Extraction  
3. Smart Search (with RAG)
4. Priority Message Detection
5. Decision Tracking

**Advanced Feature:**
6. Proactive Assistant (meeting scheduling, reminders)

## 🔧 Technical Stack

- **Architecture**: Firebase-only (no AWS Lambda)
- **AI**: OpenAI GPT-4o/4o-mini
- **Vector DB**: Pinecone for RAG
- **Agents**: AI SDK by Vercel
- **Processing**: Batch embedding every 30 seconds
- **Performance**: <3s simple operations, <15s complex operations

## 🎯 Success Criteria

- Firebase-only architecture (simpler, cheaper, faster)
- All AI processing in Firebase Cloud Functions
- Batch embedding every 30 seconds
- Perfect for our scale (10 users, 100-300 messages/day)
