MessageAI is introducing a suite of AI-powered features specifically designed for remote team professionals who struggle with information overload, context switching, and asynchronous communication challenges. This PRD outlines five required AI features plus one advanced proactive assistant capability.

---

## User Persona: Alex Chen - Remote Team Professional

### Demographics
- **Age:** 29
- **Role:** Senior Software Engineer
- **Location:** Portland, OR
- **Team:** Distributed across 4 time zones (SF, NY, London, Singapore)
- **Company:** 120-person SaaS startup
- **Years Remote:** 3 years

### Professional Context
- **Team Size:** 8-person engineering team + collaborates with 3 designers, 2 PMs
- **Daily Messages:** Receives 150-200 messages across 12+ group chats and DMs
- **Meeting Load:** 3-5 hours of meetings per day
- **Work Style:** Deep work sessions interrupted by constant message checking

### A Day in Alex's Life

**7:00 AM** - Wakes up to 47 unread messages from Singapore and London teams  
**7:30 AM** - Spends 45 minutes catching up on overnight threads, missing a critical bug report buried in #general  
**9:00 AM** - Daily standup; someone asks "didn't we decide on the API approach?" Alex can't remember which thread  
**11:00 AM** - Designer asks for feedback on mocks shared yesterday; Alex didn't see the message  
**2:00 PM** - PM asks "what are the action items from this morning's discussion?" No one documented them  
**4:00 PM** - Realizes the "urgent" message from 3 hours ago was actually routine  
**6:00 PM** - Trying to schedule a meeting with 5 people across 3 time zones via endless message pingpong  

### Pain Points (Ranked by Severity)

#### 1. Drowning in Threads (Critical)
- "I spend 2+ hours daily just reading messages to figure out what matters"
- 12 active group chats, each with 20-50 messages/day
- Context buried in long threads; can't quickly determine relevance
- FOMO prevents muting channels, leading to constant distraction

**Success Metric:** Reduce message triage time by 60%

#### 2. Missing Important Messages (Critical)
- Critical bug reports buried in casual conversations
- Design approvals lost in #general chat noise
- Blocking questions from teammates go unanswered for hours
- No clear way to identify what needs immediate attention vs. FYI

**Success Metric:** 95% of urgent messages flagged within 2 minutes

#### 3. Context Switching (High)
- Constantly bouncing between conversations to find information
- "What did we decide about the database schema?" requires scrolling through 3 days of messages
- Can't remember which thread contained that important link
- Knowledge scattered across dozens of conversations

**Success Metric:** Find any past decision or info in <10 seconds

#### 4. Time Zone Coordination (High)
- Scheduling meetings requires 10+ messages back and forth
- "When can we all meet?" remains unanswered for days
- Manually checking everyone's calendars and time zones
- Suggestions like "how about 2pm?" require mental math (2pm whose time?)

**Success Metric:** Schedule meetings with 3+ people in <5 minutes

#### 5. Action Items Fall Through Cracks (Medium)
- Verbal commitments in chat are forgotten
- "Someone should write that docs update" → no one does
- Post-meeting action items never documented
- Unclear ownership of tasks mentioned casually

**Success Metric:** 90% of action items captured and assigned

### Goals & Motivations

**Professional Goals:**
- Ship high-quality code without working 60-hour weeks
- Be responsive to teammates without constant interruptions
- Build deep focus time into daily schedule
- Maintain work-life boundaries

**What Alex Values:**
- Efficiency and productivity tools
- Clear, documented communication
- Respect for deep work time
- Team collaboration that doesn't require synchronous availability

**What Frustrates Alex:**
- Tools that add more noise
- Features that require constant manual input
- AI that gives wrong/hallucinated answers
- Systems that don't respect privacy

### Technical Savviness
- **Comfort Level:** High - Daily uses terminal, Git, multiple dev tools
- **AI Experience:** Uses ChatGPT and Copilot regularly, understands AI limitations
- **Expectations:** Wants AI that "just works" in context, not another chatbot to manage

---

## Required AI Features (All 5)

### 1. Thread Summarization

**User Story:**  
*As Alex, I want to instantly understand what happened in a long conversation thread without reading 50+ messages, so I can quickly decide if I need to engage or just stay informed.*

**Requirements:**

**Functional Requirements:**
- Generate concise summaries of any conversation thread (1-on-1 or group)
- Minimum thread length to enable: 10 messages
- Maximum thread length supported: 500 messages
- Summary length: 3-5 bullet points for threads <50 messages, up to 10 bullets for longer threads
- Identify key discussion topics, decisions made, and unresolved questions
- Highlight participants and their main contributions
- Include timestamps for context (e.g., "Early in discussion... Later, Sarah proposed...")

**Trigger Methods:**
- Long-press on any message → "Summarize Thread"
- Toolbar button: "Summarize Conversation"
- AI chat command: "Summarize the #design-review discussion from yesterday"
- Automatic: Prompt to summarize when returning to thread with 20+ unread messages

**Output Format:**
```
📝 Thread Summary (Last 24 hours, 47 messages)

Key Topics:
• Database migration strategy - team debating Postgres vs MongoDB
• Performance concerns raised by Jamie about current query times
• Timeline pressure from Sarah - needs decision by Friday

Decisions Made:
• Will run benchmarks this week (Alex assigned)
• Postponing migration discussion until benchmark results available

Still Open:
• Which database to choose - blocked on benchmarks
• Budget approval needed from finance team
```

**Performance:**
- Generate summary in <3 seconds for threads up to 100 messages
- <8 seconds for threads up to 500 messages
- Show loading state with progress indicator

**Quality Metrics:**
- Summary accuracy: 90%+ of key points captured (validated by user feedback)
- Relevance: 85%+ of users find summary useful (thumbs up/down)
- No hallucination: <2% of summaries contain information not in original thread

**Edge Cases:**
- Mixed language threads: Summarize in English, note other languages present
- Media-heavy threads: Describe images/files contextually ("Jamie shared mockup showing...")
- Very short threads: Don't offer summarization for <10 messages
- Real-time threads: Handle ongoing conversations gracefully ("Discussion ongoing...")

---

### 2. Action Item Extraction

**User Story:**  
*As Alex, I want the app to automatically identify and track action items from conversations, so nothing falls through the cracks and everyone knows their commitments.*

**Requirements:**

**Functional Requirements:**
- Automatically detect action items in conversations using NLP patterns
- Extract: Task description, assignee (if mentioned), deadline (if mentioned), context
- Support various phrasings: "I'll handle the deployment," "Can you review the PR?", "Someone needs to..."
- Distinguish between completed actions ("I finished the docs") and pending ones
- Link action items back to original message for context

**Detection Patterns:**
- Direct assignments: "Sarah, can you...", "@Alex please..."
- Self-assignments: "I'll...", "I can...", "Let me..."
- Open tasks: "We need to...", "Someone should...", "TODO:"
- Questions requiring action: "Can anyone review...?", "Who's going to...?"

**Action Item Format:**
```
✅ ACTION ITEMS from #backend-team

[ ] Deploy staging environment
    Assigned: Alex Chen (implied from "I'll handle it")
    Due: Friday EOD (mentioned in thread)
    Context: Needed for QA testing next week
    → Jump to message

[ ] Review Jamie's PR #234  
    Assigned: Sarah
    Due: Not specified
    Context: Blocking merge for release
    → Jump to message

[?] Update API documentation
    Assigned: Unassigned ("someone should...")
    Due: Not specified
    → Jump to message
```

**Trigger Methods:**
- Automatic: Process every message in real-time, update action item list
- Manual: Long-press → "Extract Action Items from Thread"
- AI chat command: "What are my action items from today?"
- Daily digest: Morning summary of all open action items

**Integration Points:**
- Dedicated "Action Items" tab in app showing all extracted tasks
- Per-conversation view showing action items from that thread
- User-specific view: "My Action Items" across all conversations
- Option to export to external task managers (nice-to-have)

**User Controls:**
- Mark action items as complete (shows checkmark, notifies relevant people)
- Dismiss false positives (improves ML over time)
- Edit action item details (assignee, deadline, description)
- Convert to proper task in external system (future: Jira/Linear integration)

**Performance:**
- Real-time detection: <1 second after message sent
- Thread scan: <5 seconds for scanning 100 messages
- Daily digest generation: <10 seconds

**Quality Metrics:**
- Precision: <10% false positives (non-action items flagged)
- Recall: 85%+ of actual action items detected
- User feedback: 80%+ find extracted items useful

**Edge Cases:**
- Hypothetical discussions: Don't flag "what if we..." as action items
- Past tense completed: Correctly identify "I finished X" as done
- Questions vs actions: "Should we do X?" is not an action, "Can you do X?" is
- Reassignments: Handle when tasks change ownership in thread

---

### 3. Smart Search

**User Story:**  
*As Alex, I want to find any message, decision, or piece of information using natural language, so I don't waste time scrolling through weeks of chat history.*

**Requirements:**

**Functional Requirements:**
- Natural language search queries (not just keyword matching)
- Semantic understanding: "that bug fix discussion" finds relevant thread even without exact words
- Search across: Messages, media captions, file names, action items, summaries
- Filters: By date range, person, conversation, message type
- Context-aware results: Show surrounding messages, not just isolated matches

**Search Capabilities:**

**Query Types Supported:**
- Keyword: "database migration" → exact/fuzzy matches
- Natural language: "when did we decide on the API approach?" → semantic search
- People: "what did Sarah say about testing?" → filter by person
- Time-based: "design discussions from last week" → temporal filtering
- Decision-focused: "what was decided about the deployment schedule?" → decision extraction
- Action-focused: "what am I supposed to work on?" → personal action items
- Topic clustering: "everything about project Phoenix" → topic-based retrieval

**RAG Pipeline Requirements:**
- Vector embeddings: Generate embeddings for all messages using text-embedding-3-large or equivalent
- Vector database: Store embeddings with metadata (timestamp, author, conversation, message type)
- Hybrid search: Combine vector similarity with keyword matching for best results
- Reranking: Use LLM to rerank results by relevance to query
- Context window: Include 3 messages before/after each result for context

**Results Display:**
```
🔍 Search: "what did we decide about the API"

Most Relevant (from #backend-team, 3 days ago)
Sarah: "Let's go with REST for now, GraphQL in v2"
        ↳ Alex: "Agreed, simpler for MVP"
        ↳ Jamie: "I'll update the docs"
Context: Discussion about API architecture for new feature
→ Jump to thread

Also Found:
• API rate limiting discussion (#infrastructure, 1 week ago)
• API documentation task (Action Items, 2 days ago)
```

**Trigger Methods:**
- Search bar: Enhanced with "✨ AI Search" option
- Voice input: "Hey MessageAI, find..." (nice-to-have)
- AI chat: "Search for database discussions from last month"
- Quick filters: Recent searches, suggested searches based on activity

**Performance:**
- Query processing: <2 seconds for simple searches
- Complex semantic queries: <5 seconds
- Update index: Real-time (new messages indexed immediately)
- Handle 10,000+ messages per user efficiently

**Quality Metrics:**
- Result relevance: 80%+ of top 3 results are useful (user clicks)
- Semantic accuracy: Natural language queries work 85%+ of the time
- Speed: 90%+ of searches return in <3 seconds

**Privacy Considerations:**
- Only search conversations user has access to
- Respect deleted messages (remove from index)
- Option to exclude specific conversations from search

**Edge Cases:**
- No results: Suggest alternative queries, broader searches
- Too many results: Auto-cluster by topic/time
- Ambiguous queries: Ask clarifying questions
- Multilingual: Handle searches across mixed-language conversations

---

### 4. Priority Message Detection

**User Story:**  
*As Alex, I want urgent, important messages automatically flagged so I can focus on what matters and safely ignore routine chatter.*

**Requirements:**

**Functional Requirements:**
- Real-time analysis of incoming messages for urgency/importance
- Visual indicators: High priority messages appear with distinct styling
- Intelligent notifications: Only notify for truly important messages
- Learn from user behavior: What Alex marks as important/dismisses as routine
- Consider multiple signals: Content, sender, conversation, time, keywords

**Priority Levels:**

**🔴 Urgent (Immediate attention required):**
- Direct mentions with urgent keywords: "@Alex we have a production outage"
- Time-sensitive: "need this reviewed before standup in 10 mins"
- Explicit urgency: "URGENT:", "CRITICAL:", "ASAP"
- Incident-related: Security alerts, system outages, customer escalations
- Blocking someone: "blocked on your review", "waiting on your approval"

**🟡 Important (Should address today):**
- Direct questions to user: "@Alex what do you think?"
- Action requests: "Can you take a look at..."
- Decisions requiring input: "Should we go with option A or B?"
- Deadline-related: "Due Friday" and today is Thursday
- Manager/stakeholder messages (configurable)

**⚪ Normal (FYI, no action needed):**
- General announcements: "Deployed to staging"
- Casual conversation: "Anyone want coffee?"
- Informational updates: "PR merged"
- Social messages: "Great job on that!"

**Detection Signals:**

**Content Analysis:**
- Urgency keywords: urgent, critical, ASAP, immediately, emergency, outage, down, broken
- Question patterns directed at user
- Action verbs: need, required, must, should, blocking
- Time pressure: "before EOD", "by tomorrow", "in 10 minutes"
- Negative sentiment: "issue", "problem", "error", "failing"

**Context Signals:**
- Conversation type: Direct messages weighted higher than large groups
- Sender importance: Manager > teammate > other (user configurable)
- Thread position: First message in thread often more important
- Mentions: Direct @mention vs. general message
- Timing: After-hours messages from team often urgent
- Follow-ups: Multiple messages from same person = escalating urgency

**User Feedback Loop:**
- User dismisses urgent flag → Learn topic/sender patterns
- User manually marks as important → Boost similar future messages
- User response time → Implicit signal of actual priority
- Thumbs up/down on priority detection accuracy

**Display & Notifications:**

**Visual Indicators:**
- 🔴 Red badge for urgent messages
- 🟡 Yellow highlight for important messages  
- Bold sender name for important messages
- Separate "Priority" section at top of message list

**Notification Strategy:**
- Urgent: Push notification + sound, even if DND mode
- Important: Push notification, respect DND mode
- Normal: No notification, badge count only
- User configurable: Override urgency levels

**Performance:**
- Real-time classification: <500ms after message received
- Accuracy target: 85% (user agrees with urgency assessment)
- False positive rate: <15% (non-urgent marked as urgent)
- False negative rate: <10% (urgent marked as non-urgent)

**User Controls:**
- Priority settings per conversation (e.g., mute priority detection in #random)
- Sender importance levels (VIP list for managers, stakeholders)
- Keyword customization (add company-specific urgent terms)
- Quiet hours (no urgent flags 10pm-7am unless from VIP list)
- Weekly report: "Your priority detection accuracy this week: 87%"

**Edge Cases:**
- Sarcasm/jokes: "URGENT: lunch spot decision" → Should not flag as urgent
- All-caps messages: Distinguish shouting from genuine urgency
- False urgency: "URGENT" used casually → Learn from user dismissals
- Cultural differences: Some teammates always use urgent language
- Escalation chains: If user ignores urgent messages, escalate notification

---

### 5. Decision Tracking

**User Story:**  
*As Alex, I want to quickly surface any decisions made in conversations so I can reference them later without re-reading entire threads.*

**Requirements:**

**Functional Requirements:**
- Automatically detect when decisions are made in conversations
- Extract decision, rationale, alternatives considered, decision maker(s), date
- Create searchable repository of all team decisions
- Link decisions to original conversation context
- Allow manual confirmation/editing of detected decisions

**Decision Detection Patterns:**

**Explicit Decision Phrases:**
- "Let's go with X"
- "We decided to..."
- "The decision is..."
- "After discussion, we'll..."
- "Agreed to proceed with..."
- "Final decision: ..."

**Consensus Signals:**
- Multiple thumbs-up reactions on a proposal
- "Everyone agree?" → followed by affirmative responses
- Poll results
- "Sounds good!" / "LGTM" / "Approved" from multiple participants

**Conclusion Signals:**
- "So to summarize, we're going with..."
- "Then it's settled"
- Thread marked as resolved
- "Closing this discussion, we'll..."

**Decision Format:**
```
📌 DECISION (from #backend-team, Oct 18, 2025)

Decision: Use PostgreSQL for user analytics database
Made by: Alex, Sarah, Jamie
Date: Oct 18, 2025, 2:47 PM

Rationale:
• Better support for complex queries
• Team has more Postgres experience
• Existing infra already uses Postgres

Alternatives Considered:
• MongoDB - Rejected due to lack of team familiarity
• MySQL - Rejected, Postgres has better JSON support

Context: 
Discussion about database choice for new analytics feature.
Performance benchmarks showed Postgres met all requirements.

→ View original thread
```

**Decision Repository:**

**Organization:**
- Chronological view: All decisions by date
- By conversation: Decisions per channel/DM
- By topic: Auto-categorize (Infrastructure, Product, Process, etc.)
- By participant: Who was involved in which decisions
- By status: Active, Superseded, Reversed

**Search & Filter:**
- "Find all database decisions from last quarter"
- "What did we decide about the deployment process?"
- "Show me decisions Sarah was involved in"
- Filter by date, participants, conversation, keywords

**Decision Lifecycle:**

**Tracking Status:**
- ✅ Active: Current decision in effect
- ⏸️ Under Review: Decision being reconsidered
- 🔄 Superseded: Newer decision replaces this one (linked)
- ❌ Reversed: Decision explicitly undone

**Change Management:**
- When new conflicting decision detected, AI prompts: "This seems to change the Oct 18 decision about PostgreSQL. Confirm?"
- Maintain history: Show what changed and why
- Alert relevant participants when decisions change

**Triggers & Access:**

**Automatic Detection:**
- Run after every message in group conversations
- Re-scan threads when marked as resolved
- Batch process overnight for low-confidence detections (prompt user to confirm)

**Manual Options:**
- Long-press message → "Mark as Decision"
- Thread menu → "Extract Decisions from Thread"
- AI chat: "What decisions were made about project Phoenix?"

**Display Locations:**
- Dedicated "Decisions" tab in app
- Per-conversation sidebar showing decisions from that thread
- AI assistant: "Show me recent decisions"
- Daily/weekly digest: "Decisions made this week"

**Performance:**
- Real-time detection: <1 second for simple decisions
- Thread scan: <5 seconds for 100 messages
- Decision repository search: <2 seconds

**Quality Metrics:**
- Precision: 80%+ of detected decisions are actual decisions
- Recall: 75%+ of actual decisions are detected
- User confirmation: Track accept/reject rate of detected decisions
- False positives: <20% (non-decisions flagged as decisions)

**User Controls:**
- Dismiss false positive decisions
- Edit decision details (description, rationale, participants)
- Manually add decisions missed by auto-detection
- Link related decisions together
- Archive old decisions (e.g., from past projects)

**Edge Cases:**
- Tentative decisions: "Let's try PostgreSQL" vs "We're definitely using PostgreSQL"
- Conditional decisions: "We'll use MongoDB if benchmarks fail"
- Individual vs. team decisions: Distinguish personal commitment from team decision
- Sarcastic/joking: "Sure, let's just rewrite everything in Rust" → Not a real decision
- Clarifications: "To be clear, we're not doing X" → Is this a decision?

**Privacy & Permissions:**
- Only show decisions from conversations user has access to
- Respect message deletion (remove associated decisions)
- Optional: Decision visibility settings per conversation

## Advanced AI Capability: Proactive Assistant

**User Story:**  
*As Alex, I want the AI to proactively suggest helpful actions before I even ask, like detecting when we need to schedule a meeting and auto-suggesting available times.*

**Requirements:**

**Functional Requirements:**
- Monitor conversations in real-time for signals that trigger proactive suggestions
- Surface suggestions at the right moment (not intrusive/spammy)
- Learn from user acceptance/rejection of suggestions
- Use function calling to access calendars, user preferences, conversation history
- Operate as a background service with occasional UI prompts

**Proactive Behaviors:**

### 1. Meeting Scheduling Assistant

**Trigger Signals:**
- Keywords: "let's meet", "we should discuss", "can we schedule", "when are you free"
- Multiple people in conversation (3+)
- Complex topic discussed over multiple messages (AI detects need for sync)
- Unresolved decision after extended async discussion

**Proactive Suggestion:**
```
💡 Smart Suggestion

Detected: You're trying to schedule a meeting with Sarah, Jamie, and Chris

Available times for all 4 people (next 7 days):
• Tomorrow (Thu) 2:00-3:00 PM PT / 5:00-6:00 PM ET / 10:00-11:00 PM London

- `get_participant_availability()`: Check other participants' calendars (if permissions granted)
- `get_time_zones()`: Determine each participant's time zone
- `suggest_meeting_times()`: Generate optimal meeting slots
- `send_calendar_invite()`: Create meeting if user approves

**Intelligence:**
- Respect working hours for each time zone
- Avoid known busy times (lunch, end of day)
- Prefer times when all participants are typically available (historical patterns)
- Suggest Zoom/Meet link automatically
- Include conversation context in meeting description

### 2. Follow-up Reminder

**Trigger Signals:**
- User assigned action item but hasn't responded in 24 hours
- Someone asked user a direct question 3+ hours ago without response
- Meeting scheduled but no agenda created (day before meeting)
- User said "I'll get back to you" but 2 days passed

**Proactive Suggestion:**
```
🔔 Gentle Reminder

You told Sarah you'd review the PR 2 days ago but haven't responded yet.

Quick actions:
[Review PR Now] [Send "Will review by EOD"] [Dismiss]
```

### 3. Context Suggester

**Trigger Signals:**
- New person joins conversation mid-discussion
- User returns to conversation after 50+ unread messages
- Someone asks "what's the status?" or "where are we on this?"
- Thread references past decision/discussion from weeks ago

**Proactive Suggestion:**
```
💡 Need context?

Jamie just joined #project-phoenix discussion. Want me to:

[Send Thread Summary] [Share Latest Decision] [Do Nothing]
```

### 4. Conflict Detector

**Trigger Signals:**
- New decision contradicts previous decision
- Double-booking detected in calendar
- Action item assigned to person already overloaded (5+ open items)
- Meeting scheduled during another meeting

**Proactive Suggestion:**
```
⚠️ Potential Conflict

[View Previous Decision] [Update Decision Log] [Ignore]
```

### 5. Smart Drafting

**Trigger Signals:**
- User starting to type response to complex question
- Similar question answered before (search history)
- User about to schedule meeting (suggest times)

**Proactive Suggestion:**
```
✍️ Suggested Reply (based on your past response to similar question)

"The database migration is scheduled for next sprint. We'll send migration guide docs by end of week. Let me know if you need access to staging for testing."

[Use This] [Edit] [Write From Scratch]
```

### 6. Priority Escalation

**Trigger Signals:**
- Urgent message ignored for 30+ minutes
- Multiple people asking "did you see X?"
- Production issue detected in conversation

**Proactive Suggestion:**
```
🚨 This might need your attention

Sarah marked a message as urgent 45 minutes ago about a production API issue.

[View Message] [Snooze 15 mins] [Mark as Seen]
```

**Agent Framework Requirements:**

**Recommended: AI SDK by Vercel**

**Why:** Streamlined, TypeScript-native, works well with React Native, excellent streaming support

**Agent Capabilities:**
- Multi-tool orchestration (calendar, messages, user preferences)
- Conversation state management across interactions
- Streaming responses for long operations
- Error recovery and retries

**Agent Tools (Function Calling):**
```typescript
const proactiveAgent = createAgent({
  model: openai('gpt-4-turbo'),
  tools: {
    getUserCalendar: tool({
      description: 'Get user calendar availability',
      parameters: z.object({
        userId: z.string(),
        startDate: z.string(),
        endDate: z.string()
      }),
      execute: async ({ userId, startDate, endDate }) => {
        // Firebase query to user calendars
      }
    }),
    
    getConversationContext: tool({
      description: 'Retrieve relevant conversation history using RAG',
      parameters: z.object({
        conversationId: z.string(),
        query: z.string()
      }),
      execute: async ({ conversationId, query }) => {
        // Vector search against conversation embeddings
      }
    }),
    
    checkUserActionItems: tool({
      description: 'Get all pending action items for user',
      parameters: z.object({
        userId: z.string()
      }),
      execute: async ({ userId }) => {
        // Query action items collection
      }
    }),
    
    sendProactiveSuggestion: tool({
      description: 'Send a proactive suggestion to user',
      parameters: z.object({
        userId: z.string(),
        suggestionType: z.enum(['meeting', 'reminder', 'context', 'conflict']),
        message: z.string(),
        actions: z.array(z.object({
          label: z.string(),
          actionType: z.string()
        }))
      }),
      execute: async (params) => {
        // Create suggestion notification in Firebase
      }
    })
  },
  
  system: `You are a proactive assistant for a messaging app.
  Monitor conversations and suggest helpful actions at appropriate times.
  Never be spammy - only suggest when truly helpful.
  Learn from user feedback (accepted vs dismissed suggestions).`
})
```

**Performance Requirements:**
- Suggestion generation: <15 seconds (includes RAG lookup + LLM reasoning)
- Background monitoring: Check messages every 30 seconds for triggers
- Calendar availability lookup: <3 seconds
- Response streaming: Start showing results within 2 seconds

**User Controls:**
- Toggle proactive suggestions on/off globally
- Configure suggestion types (enable/disable meeting scheduling, reminders, etc.)
- Set quiet hours (no suggestions 10pm-7am)
- Feedback mechanism: "This was helpful" / "Don't suggest this again"

**Learning & Adaptation:**
- Track acceptance rate per suggestion type
- Learn user's preferred meeting times from historical patterns
- Adjust frequency based on user engagement
- Store user preferences: "Never suggest meetings on Mondays"

**Quality Metrics:**
- Suggestion acceptance rate: >40% (user acts on suggestion)
- False positive rate: <30% (suggestions dismissed as unhelpful)
- Response time: 90% of suggestions generated in <15 seconds
- User satisfaction: 75%+ rate proactive suggestions as "helpful" in surveys

**Edge Cases:**
- Over-suggesting: Rate limit to max 5 suggestions per day
- Interruption timing: Don't suggest during active typing, calls, DND mode
- Privacy: Only access calendars if user grants permission
- Multi-person coordination: Handle declined meeting invites gracefully
- Conflicting suggestions: Don't suggest meeting if conversation already resolved

---

## UI/UX Integration Options

Based on the grading rubric, we need to choose between three approaches:

### Option 1: AI Chat Interface (Dedicated Assistant)

**Implementation:**
- New tab in bottom navigation: "✨ AI Assistant"
- Chat interface where users talk to AI about their conversations
- All 5 required features accessible via natural language commands

**Example Interactions:**
```
User: "Summarize the design review discussion"
AI: [Generates thread summary]

User: "What are my action items?"
AI: [Lists extracted action items from all conversations]

User: "Find that database decision from last week"
AI: [Uses smart search + decision tracking]

User: "Are there any urgent messages I missed?"
AI: [Shows priority messages]
```

**Pros:**
- Natural language interface (users already comfortable with ChatGPT-style)
- All features in one place
- Easy to add new capabilities
- Proactive assistant fits naturally (AI can start conversations)

**Cons:**
- Requires context switching (leave conversation → go to AI tab)
- Less discoverable (users might not know what to ask)
- Slower for quick actions

---

### Option 2: Contextual AI Features (Embedded)

**Implementation:**
- No separate AI tab - all features embedded in existing UI
- Long-press on message → AI actions menu
- Toolbar buttons for quick AI actions

### Option 3: Hybrid Approach (RECOMMENDED)

**Implementation:**
- Dedicated AI assistant tab for complex queries and proactive suggestions
- Contextual quick actions embedded in conversations
- Best of both worlds

**User Flow Examples:**

**Quick Action (Contextual):**
1. User sees long thread with 47 unread messages
2. Taps "📝 Summarize" button in thread header
3. Summary appears inline above messages
4. Continue reading thread normally

**Complex Query (AI Chat):**
1. User goes to AI Assistant tab
2. "What decisions have we made about the infrastructure migration?"
3. AI searches across all conversations, extracts relevant decisions
4. Shows comprehensive answer with links to original threads

**Proactive (AI Chat Initiated):**
1. AI detects scheduling discussion in #backend-team
2. Sends notification: "💡 AI Assistant has a suggestion"
3. User opens AI tab
4. AI: "I noticed you're trying to schedule with Sarah, Jamie, and Chris. Here are available times..."

**Hybrid UI Structure:**
```
Bottom Navigation:
[Chats] [Action Items] [✨ AI] [Profile]

In Conversation View:
• Toolbar: [📝 Summarize] [✅ Actions] [🔍 Search]
• Long-press menu: Translate, Extract Decision, etc.
• Priority badges on important messages

AI Assistant Tab:
• Chat interface for queries
• Proactive suggestions section
• Quick links: "My Action Items", "Recent Decisions", "Priority Messages"
```

**Pros:**
- Maximum flexibility for users
- Quick actions available in-context
- Complex queries possible via assistant
- Proactive suggestions have dedicated space
- Features discoverable in both locations

**Cons:**
- More complex to implement
- Need to avoid feature duplication/confusion

- **10K users/month:** $0.60-0.90 per user ($6000-9000 total)

### Architecture Patterns

**Required Components:**
1. **LLM Integration** (OpenAI GPT-4o/4o-mini)
2. **Agent Framework** (AI SDK by Vercel)
3. **RAG Pipeline** (Pinecone + OpenAI embeddings)
4. **Cloud Functions** (Firebase + AWS Lambda)
5. **Real-time Processing** (Firebase listeners)

### RAG Pipeline Specification

**Purpose:** Give LLMs access to conversation history for context-aware responses

**Components:**

1. **Embedding Generation:**
   - Model: OpenAI `text-embedding-3-large` (3072 dimensions)
   - Trigger: Embed every message when sent (Firebase Function → Pinecone)
   - Batch processing: Embed existing messages on first setup
   - Metadata stored with each vector:
     - userId: string
     - conversationId: string
     - timestamp: number (Unix timestamp)
     - messageType: 'text' | 'media' | 'system'
     - sender: string (user ID)
     - messageText: string (first 500 chars for preview)

2. **Vector Database: Pinecone**
   - **Index name:** `messageai-conversations`
   - **Dimensions:** 3072
   - **Metric:** cosine similarity
   - **Cloud:** AWS us-east-1 (same region as Lambda)
   - **Pod type:** Starter (free tier) → Standard ($70/month at scale)
   - Real-time updates via Firebase trigger

3. **Retrieval Strategy:**
   - **Step 1:** Vector similarity search (top 20 results)
   - **Step 2:** Metadata filtering (date range, conversation, sender)
   - **Step 3:** Keyword boosting for exact matches
   - **Step 4:** GPT-4o reranking (top 20 → top 5 most relevant)
   - **Step 5:** Context expansion (fetch ±3 messages around each result)
   - **Step 6:** Return results with full context

4. **Query Flow:**
   ```
   User query (natural language)
         ↓
   Generate query embedding (OpenAI API)
         ↓
   Pinecone similarity search (top 20)
   + Apply metadata filters (userId, date range)
         ↓
   Keyword matching boost (if exact phrase matches)
         ↓
   GPT-4o reranking (semantic relevance scoring)
         ↓
   Fetch surrounding context from Firestore (±3 messages)
         ↓
   Return top 5 results with full context
   ```

5. **Performance Targets:**
   - Embedding generation: <500ms per message
   - Vector search: <200ms
   - Reranking: <1-2 seconds
   - Total search time: <3 seconds

6. **Cost Optimization:**
   - Cache frequent queries in Firestore (10-minute TTL)
   - Skip reranking for simple keyword searches
   - Batch embed messages (reduce API calls)

### Function Calling / Tool Use

**Framework: AI SDK by Vercel**

**Required Tools for Agent:**

```typescript
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai'
import { generateText, tool } from 'ai'

      topic: z.string().optional(),
      dateRange: z.object({
        start: z.string(),
        end: z.string()
      }).optional()
    }),
    execute: async ({ conversationId, topic, dateRange }) => {
      return await queryFirestore('decisions', { conversationId, topic, dateRange })
    }
  }),
  
  // 4. Calendar Integration Tool
  get_user_calendar: tool({
    description: 'Get user calendar availability',
    parameters: z.object({

        start: z.string(),
        end: z.string()
      })
    }),
    execute: async ({ userId, dateRange }) => {
      return await getCalendarAvailability(userId, dateRange)
    }
  }),
  
  // 5. Priority Message Tool
  get_priority_messages: tool({
    description: 'Get high-priority messages for a user',
    parameters: z.object({
      userId: z.string(),
      limit: z.number().optional()
    }),
    execute: async ({ userId, limit = 10 }) => {
      return await queryFirestore('messages', { 
        userId, 
        priority: { $in: ['urgent', 'important'] },
        limit 
      })
    }
  }),
  
  // 6. Proactive Suggestion Tool
  send_proactive_suggestion: tool({
    description: 'Send a proactive suggestion notification to the user',
    parameters: z.object({
      userId: z.string(),
      conversationId: z.string(),
      suggestionType: z.enum(['meeting', 'reminder', 'context', 'conflict']),
      message: z.string(),
      actions: z.array(z.object({
        label: z.string(),
        actionType: z.string(),
        payload: z.any()
      }))
    }),
    execute: async (params) => {
      return await createProactiveSuggestion(params)
    }
  }),
  
  // 7. User Preferences Tool
  get_user_preferences: tool({
    description: 'Get user AI preferences and settings',
    parameters: z.object({
      userId: z.string()
    }),
    execute: async ({ userId }) => {
      return await queryFirestore('user_preferences', { userId })
    }
  })
}

// Example usage in proactive agent
const result = await generateText({
  model: openai('gpt-4o'),
  tools: agentTools,
  maxSteps: 5, // Allow multi-step reasoning
  system: `You are a proactive assistant for MessageAI...`,
  prompt: userQuery
})
```

**AI SDK Features Used:**
- **Structured Output:** `generateObject()` with Zod schemas for action items, decisions
- **Streaming:** `streamText()` for long-running operations
- **Multi-step Agents:** `maxSteps` parameter for complex reasoning chains
- **Tool Calling:** Declarative tool definitions with type safety

### Rate Limiting & Cost Management

**Requirements:**
- Rate limiting per user: 100 AI requests/day
- Caching: Cache common queries (thread summaries, action items) for 5 minutes
- Cost monitoring: Track API usage per feature
- Fallback: If rate limit hit, queue requests and process during off-peak

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// Firestore-based rate limiting
const checkRateLimit = async (userId: string) => {
  const today = new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0]
  const counterRef = db.collection('rate_limits').doc(`${userId}_${today}`)
  
  const counter = await db.runTransaction(async (transaction) => {
    const doc = await transaction.get(counterRef)
    const count = doc.exists ? doc.data().count : 0
    
    if (count >= 100) {
      throw new Error('Daily AI request limit reached')
    }
    
    transaction.set(counterRef, { 
      count: count + 1,
      expiresAt: Date.now() + (24 * 60 * 60 * 1000)
    })
    
    return count + 1
  })
  
  return counter
}
```

## Open Questions & Risks

### Technical Risks
1. **LLM Costs:** At scale, costs could exceed $3/user/month target
   - Mitigation: Aggressive caching, smaller models for simple tasks, user limits
   
2. **Latency:** AI features might be too slow (>5s response times)
   - Mitigation: Response streaming, optimistic UI, background processing
   
3. **Accuracy:** AI might produce too many false positives/negatives
   - Mitigation: User feedback loops, confidence thresholds, human-in-loop for critical actions

### Product Risks
1. **User Adoption:** Users might not discover or use AI features
   - Mitigation: Onboarding flow, proactive suggestions, in-app education
   
2. **Privacy Concerns:** Users might not want AI reading their messages
   - Mitigation: Clear privacy policy, opt-in, strong security messaging
   
3. **Over-Reliance:** Users might trust AI too much and miss important nuances
   - Mitigation: Always show original messages, caveat AI outputs, show confidence scores

### Business Risks
1. **Differentiation:** Competitors might copy AI features quickly
   - Mitigation: Focus on execution quality, continuous iteration, proprietary insights
   
2. **Pricing:** Unclear if users will pay for AI features
   - Mitigation: Freemium model, demonstrate value before paywall

   • Sarah deployed fix 10 minutes ago
   • Monitoring for next hour
   → No action needed from you
   ```

3. Swipes to manager's message → Proactive assistant suggests:
   ```
   💡 Quick Reply Suggestion
   Based on yesterday's standup notes:
   "Feature X is 80% done. Finishing tests today, will merge tomorrow."
   [Send] [Edit] [Ignore]
   ```

4. Checks Action Items tab → Shows:
   ```
   ✅ YOUR ACTION ITEMS (3 due today)

### Flow 3: Finding a Past Decision

**Context:** Alex needs to reference a database decision from 3 weeks ago

**Old Way (without AI):**
1. Opens #backend-team
2. Scrolls up... and up... and up...
3. Gives up, asks in channel: "What did we decide about the database?"
4. Waits for someone to remember and respond
5. Total time: 10-20 minutes

**New Way (with AI):**
1. Opens AI Assistant tab
2. Types: "what did we decide about the database?"

3. **AI responds (2 seconds later):**
   ```
   📌 Found 2 relevant decisions:
   
   1. PostgreSQL for Analytics DB (Oct 18, 2025)
      • Decided by: Alex, Sarah, Jamie
      • Rationale: Better query performance, team experience
      • Status: ✅ Active, implemented last week

   ```

4. Alex: "the postgres one"

5. **AI shows full decision details:**
   ```
   📌 FULL DECISION DETAILS
   
   Decision: Use PostgreSQL for User Analytics Database
   Date: Oct 18, 2025, 2:47 PM
   Conversation: #backend-team
   Made by: Alex, Sarah, Jamie (3 participants)
   
   Context:
   Discussion about database choice for new analytics feature.
   Requirements: Complex queries, JSON support, team familiarity.
   
   Decision:
   Go with PostgreSQL over MongoDB and MySQL.
   
   Rationale:
   • Better support for complex analytical queries
   • Team has more experience with Postgres
   • Existing infrastructure already uses Postgres (less operational overhead)
   • JSON support via jsonb columns meets our needs
   
   Alternatives Considered:
   • MongoDB - Rejected: Team lacks experience, concern about complex query performance
   • MySQL - Rejected: Postgres has superior JSON support
   
   Implementation Notes:
   • Benchmarks showed Postgres met all latency requirements (<100ms)
   • Sarah volunteered to set up initial schema
   • Migration plan documented in Notion
   
   Related Decisions:
   • Redis caching strategy (Oct 20) [View]
   • API design for analytics endpoints (Oct 22) [View]
   
   [View Original Thread] [Edit Decision] [Mark as Superseded]
   ```

**Result:** Found decision in 10 seconds vs. 10-20 minutes of searching/asking around.
