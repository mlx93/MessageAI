## ðŸ“Š **Cost Estimation**

### Scenario 1: Small App (100 users)
- 100 users each invite 5 friends = 500 invites
- Cost: $5/month (phone + SMS)

### Scenario 2: Medium App (1,000 users)  
- 1,000 users each invite 5 friends = 5,000 invites
- Cost: $41/month (phone + SMS)

### Scenario 3: Large App (10,000 users)
- 10,000 users each invite 5 friends = 50,000 invites  
- Cost: $396/month (phone + SMS)

**Note:** Most users won't invite 5 friends. Real conversion ~2-3 invites per user.
