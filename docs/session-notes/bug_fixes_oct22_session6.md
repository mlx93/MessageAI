## 🐛 Bugs Fixed

### 1. ✅ iPhone Vertical Scrolling Not Working

**Problem:**  
Vertical scrolling (up/down to view message history) worked on Android but not on iPhone.

**Root Cause:**  
`TouchableWithoutFeedback` wrapper around the `ScrollView` was blocking scroll gestures on iOS. This wrapper was added to dismiss the "add participant" mode when tapping outside, but it interfered with scrolling.

**Solution:**  
Removed the `TouchableWithoutFeedback` wrapper entirely. The add mode can still be dismissed via the cancel button, which is sufficient UX.

**Files Changed:**
- `app/chat/[id].tsx`

**Changes:**
```typescript
// BEFORE: TouchableWithoutFeedback blocked scrolling
<TouchableWithoutFeedback onPress={() => isAddMode && handleCancelAdd()}>
  <View style={styles.messagesWrapper}>
    <ScrollView>
      {/* messages */}
    </ScrollView>
  </View>
</TouchableWithoutFeedback>

// AFTER: Removed wrapper
<View style={styles.messagesWrapper}>
  <ScrollView>
    {/* messages */}
  </ScrollView>
</View>
```

**Impact:**
- ✅ Vertical scrolling now works perfectly on iPhone
- ✅ No change to Android (already working)
- ✅ Add mode can still be dismissed via cancel button

### 2. ✅ Unread Badge Flash on Page Transition

**Problem:**  
When navigating back from a conversation to the Messages page, the unread message badge briefly flashed on screen before clearing. This created an awkward visual glitch where users saw a stale unread count momentarily.

**Root Cause:**  
The optimistic unread count clearing only happened when the Messages page regained focus (via `useFocusEffect`). But by that time, the real-time Firestore listener might have already rendered with the old unread count, causing a flash.

**Solution:**  
Clear the unread count **optimistically BEFORE navigation** rather than after returning. This updates the local state immediately when tapping a conversation, preventing any flash when returning.

**Files Changed:**
- `app/(tabs)/index.tsx`

**Changes:**
```typescript
const handlePress = () => {
  // Optimistically clear unread count IMMEDIATELY to prevent flash
  setConversations(prevConvos => 
    prevConvos.map(conv => {
      if (conv.id === item.id && user) {
        return {
          ...conv,
          unreadCounts: {
            ...conv.unreadCounts,
            [user.uid]: 0
          }
        };
      }
      return conv;
    })
  );
  
  // Then navigate
  router.push(`/chat/${item.id}`);
};
```

**Impact:**
- ✅ No more flash of unread count when returning to Messages page
- ✅ Smooth, instant clearing of badge
- ✅ Professional UX polish

### 3. ✅ Old Dismissed Push Notifications Reappearing

**Problem:**  
After force-quitting the app and reopening it, old dismissed push notifications would reappear in the notification center. This happened even though users had already dismissed them before closing the app.

**Root Cause:**  
Notifications were only cleared once on app launch (in a `useEffect` with empty deps). When the app was resumed from background (not a fresh launch), the old notifications persisted.

**Solution:**  
Added an `AppState` listener to dismiss all notifications **every time the app comes to foreground**, not just on initial launch. This ensures clean notification center on both:
- Fresh app launch
- Resume from background
- Resume after force-quit

**Files Changed:**
- `app/_layout.tsx`

**Changes:**
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  // Clear on launch
  dismissAllDeliveredNotifications();

  // ALSO clear on every foreground transition
  const handleAppStateChange = (nextAppState: string) => {
    if (nextAppState === 'active') {
      console.log('🧹 App became active - clearing stale notifications');
      dismissAllDeliveredNotifications();
    }
  };

  const subscription = AppState.addEventListener('change', handleAppStateChange);

  return () => {
    subscription?.remove();
  };
}, []);
```

**Impact:**
- ✅ No more old notifications after force-quit and reopen
- ✅ Clean notification center on every app resume
- ✅ Professional notification management

### 4. ✅ User Status Shows "Background" When Force-Closed

**Problem:**  
When a user force-closes the app, other users still see them as "background" (yellow indicator) indefinitely. The user should show as "offline" (no indicator, "Last seen..." text) when the app is completely closed, not just backgrounded.

**Root Cause:**  
The presence system has three states:
- `online: true, inApp: true` = **Green indicator** (actively using app)
- `online: true, inApp: false` = **Yellow indicator** (app in background but connected)
- `online: false` = **No indicator** (offline, show "Last seen...")

When force-closing the app:
1. No code runs to set `online: false` (app is terminated)
2. The `AppState` listener doesn't fire (no process running)
3. User's Firestore presence remains `online: true, inApp: false` forever
4. Other users see them as "background" indefinitely

**Clarification:**  
- **"Background"** = App is running in background, user still connected, will return soon (temporary state)
- **"Offline"** = App is closed, user not connected, may not return for a while (stale state)

**Solution:**  
Implemented **staleness detection** using the `lastSeen` timestamp:
- If `lastSeen` is older than **2 minutes**, consider user offline regardless of `online` flag
- Only show green/yellow indicators if `lastSeen` is fresh (< 2 min)
- This automatically handles force-quit without needing to detect it explicitly

**Files Changed:**
- `app/chat/[id].tsx` (chat header subtitle and indicator)
- `app/(tabs)/index.tsx` (conversations list indicator)

**Changes:**

**Chat Screen:**
```typescript
// Add presence status with staleness detection
const minutesAgo = otherUserLastSeen 
  ? Math.floor((new Date().getTime() - otherUserLastSeen.getTime()) / 60000)
  : Infinity;
const isStale = minutesAgo >= 2;

if (otherUserOnline && otherUserInApp && !isStale) {
  subtitle = 'online'; // Green indicator
} else if (otherUserOnline && !otherUserInApp && !isStale) {
  subtitle = 'background'; // Yellow indicator
} else if (otherUserLastSeen) {
  // Offline or stale - show last seen
  subtitle = `Last seen ${minutesAgo}m ago`;
}
```

**Conversations List:**
```typescript
{(() => {
  if (item.type !== 'direct' || !isOnline) return null;
  
  // Check staleness before showing indicator
  const lastSeen = otherUserId ? presenceMap[otherUserId]?.lastSeen : undefined;
  const minutesAgo = lastSeen 
    ? Math.floor((new Date().getTime() - lastSeen.getTime()) / 60000)
    : Infinity;
  const isStale = minutesAgo >= 2;
  
  if (isStale) return null; // Don't show indicator if stale
  
  return (
    <View style={[
      styles.onlineIndicator, 
      { backgroundColor: isInApp ? '#34C759' : '#FFD60A' }
    ]} />
  );
})()}
```

**Impact:**
- ✅ Users show offline after 2 minutes of inactivity (handles force-quit)
- ✅ Green indicator = actively using app (< 2 min since last activity)
- ✅ Yellow indicator = app in background but connected (< 2 min since last activity)
- ✅ No indicator = offline or force-closed (> 2 min since last activity)
- ✅ Accurate presence status without needing force-quit detection

## 📊 Presence Status Definitions

After these fixes, here's how presence status works:

### Visual Indicators

| Status | Indicator | Text | Meaning |
|--------|-----------|------|---------|
| **Online (Active)** | 🟢 Green dot | "online" | User is actively in the app, < 2 min since last activity |
| **Background** | 🟡 Yellow dot | "background" | User logged in, app in background, < 2 min since last activity |
| **Offline** | None | "Last seen 5m ago" | User offline, force-closed, or > 2 min since last activity |

### State Transitions

1. **User opens app:**
   - `online: true, inApp: true, lastSeen: now`
   - Shows: 🟢 "online"

2. **User switches to another app (backgrounds it):**
   - `online: true, inApp: false, lastSeen: now`
   - Shows: 🟡 "background"

3. **User returns to app from background:**
   - `online: true, inApp: true, lastSeen: now`
   - Shows: 🟢 "online"

4. **User force-closes app:**
   - No code runs, remains: `online: true, inApp: false, lastSeen: <old timestamp>`
   - After 2 min: Shows "Last seen 2m ago" (no indicator)

5. **User signs out:**
   - `online: false, inApp: false, lastSeen: now`
   - Shows: "Last seen just now"

## 💡 Key Insights

### 1. iOS Touch Event Quirks
`TouchableWithoutFeedback` can interfere with `ScrollView` on iOS, even when they're in a parent-child relationship. Android handles this better. Always test touch interactions on both platforms.

### 2. Optimistic UI Updates
For instant UX, update local state **before** actions that trigger navigation or async operations. Don't wait for callbacks or focus events.

### 3. AppState Lifecycle
When testing app lifecycle events:
- **App launch:** `useEffect` with empty deps runs
- **Background → Foreground:** `AppState` listener fires with 'active'
- **Force quit → Reopen:** Treated as fresh launch (no state persisted)

Always handle both scenarios for robust behavior.

### 4. Presence Without Heartbeats
Using **timestamp staleness** (checking if `lastSeen` is old) is simpler and more reliable than trying to detect force-quit events. It naturally handles:
- Force-quit (no code runs, timestamp becomes stale)
- Network loss (no updates, timestamp becomes stale)
- Crashed app (same effect)

Threshold of 2 minutes balances accuracy with tolerance for temporary network issues.
