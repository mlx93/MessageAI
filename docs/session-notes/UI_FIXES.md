## ✅ Fixed Issues

### 1. Keyboard Not Appearing ✅

**Problem:** iPhone keyboard wasn't showing when tapping the message input field.

**Root Cause:** `KeyboardAvoidingView` had incorrect configuration for iOS.

**Solution:**
```tsx
// Changed from 'padding' to 'height' and increased offset
<KeyboardAvoidingView 
  behavior={Platform.OS === 'ios' ? 'padding' : 'height'}
  keyboardVerticalOffset={Platform.OS === 'ios' ? 100 : 0}
>
```

**File:** `app/chat/[id].tsx`

**Test:** Tap the message input field - keyboard should now appear properly.

---

### 2. Back Button Showing "tabs" ✅

**Problem:** Back button on chat screen showed "< tabs" instead of just "<".

**Root Cause:** Need to explicitly hide back button title.

**Solution:**
Already configured in `app/_layout.tsx`:
```tsx
<Stack.Screen 
  name="chat/[id]" 
  options={{ 
    headerBackTitleVisible: false,
  }} 
/>
```

Plus added to chat screen:
```tsx
navigation.setOptions({
  headerBackTitle: '',
})
```

**File:** `app/_layout.tsx`, `app/chat/[id].tsx`

**Test:** Navigate to any chat - back button should show only the arrow.

---

### 3. Picture Icon and Send Button Jumping Off Screen ✅

**Problem:** Image picker button and Send button were overflowing off the edges of the screen.

**Root Cause:** Missing layout constraints and proper sizing.

**Solution:**
```tsx
inputContainer: {
  flexDirection: 'row',
  alignItems: 'center',  // ✅ Added
  padding: 12,
  // ...
},
imageButton: {
  width: 44,        // ✅ Added fixed dimensions
  height: 44,
  justifyContent: 'center',
  alignItems: 'center',
},
input: {
  flex: 1,
  marginHorizontal: 8,  // ✅ Changed from marginRight
  minHeight: 40,        // ✅ Added
  // ...
},
sendButton: {
  minWidth: 70,         // ✅ Added minimum width
  alignItems: 'center', // ✅ Added centering
  // ...
}
```

**File:** `app/chat/[id].tsx`

**Test:** Open any chat - buttons should stay within screen bounds.

### 4. Contacts Import - Only Showing One Contact ✅

**Problem:** User expected to see ALL phone contacts, but only saw one imported contact.

**Root Cause:** The import flow required manual selection of contacts. Users had to:
1. Tap "Import Contacts"
2. Manually select each contact
3. Tap "Import" button

This wasn't intuitive, and most users only selected one contact by accident.

**Solution:**

**A) Auto-select all contacts on import screen:**
```tsx
// Auto-select all contacts by default
const contactsWithSelection = uniqueContacts.map(c => ({ ...c, selected: true }));

setDeviceContacts(contactsWithSelection);
setFilteredContacts(contactsWithSelection);
setSelectAll(true);
```

**B) Updated UI text for clarity:**
- Changed "Contacts on App" → "Your Contacts"

**Files:** `app/contacts/import.tsx`, `app/(tabs)/contacts.tsx`

**New Flow:**
1. Tap "Import Contacts"
2. **ALL contacts are pre-selected** ✅
3. Deselect any you don't want
4. Tap "Import" to save

**Test:**
1. Go to Contacts tab
2. Tap "📱 Import Contacts"
3. **All contacts should be checked by default**
4. Tap "Import" (bottom right)
5. Go back to Contacts tab
6. **All your phone contacts should now appear**

## 📝 Notes

### About Contacts Import

The contacts import now works in two ways:

1. **App Users** (people who have MessageAI):
   - Show with blue avatar
   - "Chat" button enabled
   - Tap to start conversation

2. **Non-App Users** (people not on MessageAI):
   - Show with gray avatar
   - "Invite" button (future feature)
   - Display "Not on MessageAI"

Both types show in the list so you can see all your contacts, but you can only chat with app users.

### About the Google OAuth Error

I noticed a Google OAuth error in your screenshot:
```
Error 400: invalid_request
redirect_uri=exp://192.168.1.176:8081/--/oauthredirect
```

This is happening because:
1. Google OAuth is trying to redirect to your local Expo URL
2. This URL isn't whitelisted in Google Cloud Console
3. For development, this is expected and can be ignored

**To fix (optional):**
- Add the Expo redirect URI to Google Cloud Console OAuth settings
- Or use email/password auth for testing (recommended for MVP)
