# How to Get Your OTP Code for Real Phone Numbers

**For Development:** Since Twilio isn't configured yet, SMS won't be sent to real phone numbers. But the code is generated and logged in Firebase Cloud Functions.

---

## üîç **Method 1: Check Firebase Logs**

### Step 1: Enter Your Phone Number in App
Enter your phone number (e.g., 832-655-9250) and tap "Send Code"

### Step 2: Check Cloud Function Logs

Run this command in terminal:
```bash
cd /Users/mylessjs/Desktop/MessageAI
firebase functions:log --only sendPhoneVerificationCode --lines 10
```

### Step 3: Find Your Code

Look for a line like:
```
? sendphoneverificationcode: Generated OTP for +18326559250: 372817
```

The 6-digit number (e.g., **372817**) is your code!

### Step 4: Enter Code in App
Enter the 6-digit code in the verification screen.

## ‚è±Ô∏è **Important: Code Expiration**

- Codes expire after **5 minutes**
- If expired, tap "Resend code" and get the new code from logs
- Test numbers (650-555-xxxx) always use code **123456** and never expire

## üéØ **Quick Test Commands**

```bash
firebase functions:log --only sendPhoneVerificationCode --lines 5
```

### Watch logs in real-time:
```bash
