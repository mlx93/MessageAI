## Technical Implementation

### Google OAuth Configuration
```typescript
const [request, response, promptAsync] = Google.useAuthRequest({
  iosClientId: '290630072291-c5m9hc72nk0lvh6g9j9mfvb6fqjb0h8v.apps.googleusercontent.com',
  androidClientId: '290630072291-8rfm0qk3vn9f4d0q5h5v8j5v8j5v8j5v.apps.googleusercontent.com',
  webClientId: '290630072291-c5m9hc72nk0lvh6g9j9mfvb6fqjb0h8v.apps.googleusercontent.com',
});
```

### Error Handling
Social auth functions throw specific errors:
- `PHONE_REQUIRED`: User needs to provide phone number
- Other errors: Standard authentication failures

Example:
```typescript
try {
  await signInWithGoogle(idToken);
} catch (error) {
  if (error.message === 'PHONE_REQUIRED') {
    // Show phone prompt modal
  }
}
```

### Profile Creation
When a new user signs in via social auth:
1. Firebase Auth user created automatically
2. Firestore profile created with available data
3. Missing fields (like phone) flagged for collection
4. User prompted to complete profile

- ‚úÖ HTTPS only communication
- ‚úÖ Firebase handles token refresh
- ‚úÖ No client-side token storage

### Privacy
- ‚úÖ Apple Sign-In supports email privacy
- ‚úÖ Google provides verified email only
- ‚úÖ Phone numbers normalized and validated
- ‚úÖ No passwords stored for social auth users

### Data Handling
- ‚úÖ Minimal data collected from OAuth providers
- ‚úÖ User can skip phone (temporary)
- ‚úÖ Profile completion flow ensures required data
- ‚úÖ All data stored securely in Firestore
