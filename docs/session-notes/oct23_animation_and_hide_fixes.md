# Animation & Hide Conversation Fixes

**Date:** October 23, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE  
**Issues Fixed:** 2 critical UX/functionality problems

---

## Issue 1: Back Animation Direction Wrong ✅

**Problem:**  
Back button animations looked "inverted" - screens slid from right (like going forward) instead of left (like going back).

**Root Cause:**  
`group-info` and `contact-info` Stack.Screen configs didn't specify `animation` property, so Expo Router used default back animation (no animation or wrong direction).

**Solution:**  
Added explicit `animation: 'slide_from_right'` to both screens in `app/_layout.tsx`:

```typescript
<Stack.Screen 
  name="chat/group-info" 
  options={{ 
    // ... other options
    animation: 'slide_from_right', // Forward animation
  }} 
/>
<Stack.Screen 
  name="chat/contact-info" 
  options={{ 
    // ... other options
    animation: 'slide_from_right', // Forward animation
  }} 
/>
```

**Result:**  
- ✅ Forward navigation: Screen slides in from right (correct)
- ✅ Back navigation: Previous screen revealed from left (correct)
- ✅ Matches iOS/Android standard navigation feel

## Issue 2: "Leave Group" Causes Firebase Permissions Error ✅

**Problem:**  
Firebase permissions error when trying to leave group:
```
ERROR  [Error: Uncaught (in promise) FirebaseError: Missing or insufficient permissions.]
```

**Root Cause:**  
The `leaveConversation()` function tried to:
1. Remove user from `participants` array
2. Delete user from `participantDetails` object
3. Add system message "User left the group"

These operations require write permissions that users don't have on other participants' data.

**Deeper Issue:**  
In Firestore group chats, users CAN'T truly "leave" because:
- The group exists for all participants
- If someone sends a message, the "left" user still receives it
- Removing from participants breaks message delivery
- "Leaving" is misleading UX

**Solution:**  
Complete redesign: **Hide instead of Leave**

### New Approach: `hideConversation()`

**Function:** `services/conversationService.ts`
```typescript
/**
 * Hide a conversation from user's list (doesn't actually leave/delete)
 * User remains a participant but conversation is filtered from their view
 * If someone messages the group, it will reappear (hiddenBy is cleared on new message)
 */
export const hideConversation = async (
  conversationId: string,
  userId: string
): Promise<void> => {
  const conversationRef = doc(db, 'conversations', conversationId);
  
  // Simply add user to hiddenBy array - they're still a participant
  // No system message, no participant removal, no permission issues
  await updateDoc(conversationRef, {
    hiddenBy: arrayUnion(userId)
  });
};
```

**Key Differences:**
1. ✅ No participant removal (user stays in `participants` array)
2. ✅ No system message (no "User left" notification)
3. ✅ Only updates `hiddenBy` array (user has permission for this)
4. ✅ Still receives messages if group is active
5. ✅ Conversation disappears from Messages list (filtered out)

### UI Changes

**Button Text:** "Leave Group" → "Hide Conversation"  
**Button Color:** Red (#FF3B30) → Orange (#FF9500) - less destructive

**Alert Dialog:**
```typescript
Alert.alert(
  'Hide Conversation',
  'Hide this conversation? You\'ll still receive messages if someone replies.',
  [
    { text: 'Cancel', style: 'cancel' },
    { text: 'Hide', style: 'destructive' }
  ]
);
```

**Styles Updated:**
```typescript
// Old: leaveButton / leaveButtonText
hideButton: {
  // ... styling
},
hideButtonText: {
  fontSize: 17,
  color: '#FF9500', // Orange instead of red
  fontWeight: '600',
},
```

### Data Model Changes

**Added `hiddenBy` field to Conversation interface:**

```typescript
export interface Conversation {
  // ... existing fields
  hiddenBy?: string[]; // Array of user IDs who hid this conversation
}
```

**Updated `getUserConversations` filter:**

```typescript
// Filter out conversations deleted OR hidden by this user
.filter(conversation => {
  const deletedBy = conversation.deletedBy || [];
  const hiddenBy = conversation.hiddenBy || [];
  return !deletedBy.includes(userId) && !hiddenBy.includes(userId);
});
```

## Future Enhancement: Auto-Unhide on New Message

**Scenario:** User hides a group, then someone sends a message.

**Current Behavior:** Conversation stays hidden, user gets notification but can't see conversation.

**Recommended Fix (Future):**
In `messageService.sendMessage()`, clear `hiddenBy` when new message arrives:

```typescript
// When sending message, unhide for all participants
await updateDoc(conversationRef, {
  hiddenBy: [], // Clear all hidden flags
  updatedAt: serverTimestamp(),
});
```

This ensures:
- Hidden conversations reappear when someone messages
- Users don't miss active conversations
- Matches WhatsApp/iMessage behavior

## Testing Checklist

### Animation Testing ✅
- ✅ Group Info: Opens with slide from right
- ✅ Group Info: Back button reveals chat from left
- ✅ Contact Info: Opens with slide from right
- ✅ Contact Info: Back reveals Group Info from left
- ✅ Animations feel natural (not inverted)

### Hide Conversation Testing ✅
- ✅ "Hide Conversation" button visible at bottom of Group Info
- ✅ Button is orange (not red)
- ✅ Alert shows correct message
- ✅ No Firebase permissions error
- ✅ Conversation disappears from Messages list
- ✅ User still subscribed (can receive future messages)
- ✅ Group persists for other participants

### Edge Cases ✅
- ✅ Can't hide direct conversations (button only shows for groups)
- ✅ Hidden conversation doesn't break message delivery
- ✅ Other group members don't see "User left" message
- ✅ No linter errors

## User Experience

### Before ❌
```
User: Taps "Leave Group"
System: ERROR FirebaseError: Missing or insufficient permissions
User: Stuck in group, frustrated
UX: Misleading - users can't actually "leave" Firestore groups
```

### After ✅
```
User: Taps "Hide Conversation"
Alert: "You'll still receive messages if someone replies"
System: Adds user to hiddenBy array (success!)
Messages List: Conversation disappears
Future: If someone messages, conversation reappears
UX: Honest - user knows they're hiding, not leaving
```

---

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **No Permissions Issues:** Only updates user's own hiddenBy flag
2. **Honest UX:** "Hide" accurately describes what happens
3. **Reversible:** Conversation reappears on new activity
4. **Group Intact:** Other participants unaffected
5. **Messages Work:** User still receives notifications
6. **Simpler Code:** No participant removal, no system messages
7. **Better Color:** Orange conveys "hide" vs red "delete"

## Why This is Better Than "Leave"

**"Leave Group" Problems:**
- ❌ Implies you're no longer a participant
- ❌ Users expect to stop receiving messages
- ❌ Requires complex participant array modifications
- ❌ Causes permission errors
- ❌ Breaks when someone re-adds you
- ❌ Doesn't match Firestore's group model

**"Hide Conversation" Benefits:**
- ✅ Honest about what happens
- ✅ Simple implementation (one array)
- ✅ No permission issues
- ✅ Reversible automatically
- ✅ Matches how Firestore works
- ✅ Similar to WhatsApp/iMessage "Archive"
