# MessageAI Testing Roadmap
**Created**: October 21, 2025  
**Status**: Testing Phase Not Started  
**Goal**: 70%+ Coverage + 7 E2E Scenarios Automated

---

## Executive Summary

### Current State: Critical Testing Gaps ‚ö†Ô∏è

**What's Built**: 100% of MVP features implemented and manually tested  
**What's Tested**: ~5% - mostly placeholder tests with `expect(true).toBe(true)`

**The Problem**:
- 11 test files exist but contain minimal logic
- Firebase Emulator setup deferred (Task 1.6b)
- Integration tests non-existent
- E2E tests non-existent
- Coverage never measured
- No CI/CD automation

**The Risk**:
- Regressions invisible until user reports
- Refactoring is dangerous without test safety net
- Can't ship to production with confidence
- Firebase costs could spike from bugs (infinite loops, etc.)

---

By end of testing roadmap (12 hours), MessageAI will have:

‚úÖ **Firebase Emulator**: Running with npm scripts  
‚úÖ **Integration Tests**: 5 test files covering Auth, Messages, Conversations, Offline, SQLite  
‚úÖ **Unit Tests**: 5 test files expanded from placeholders  
‚úÖ **E2E Tests**: 7 Maestro flows for all critical scenarios  
‚úÖ **Security Rules Tests**: Email/phone uniqueness enforced  
‚úÖ **Coverage**: 70%+ statements, 60%+ branches  
‚úÖ **Documentation**: TESTING_GUIDE.md with setup instructions

---

## Quick Start: First 30 Minutes

To get started immediately:

```bash
# 1. Setup Firebase Emulator (10 min)
firebase init emulators
# Select: Auth (9099), Firestore (8080), Functions (5001), Storage (9199)

# 2. Create emulator connector (10 min)
# Create services/__tests__/setup.ts with connectAuthEmulator, etc.

# 3. Write first integration test (10 min)
# Create services/__tests__/authService.integration.test.ts
# Test: Sign up with phone ‚Üí verify user created in Firestore

# 4. Run test against emulator
npm run test:emulators  # In one terminal
npm run test:integration  # In another terminal

# Expected: ‚úÖ 1 passing test
```

## Comparison: Original vs. Improved Prompt

| Aspect | Original Prompt | Improved Prompt |
|--------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Context** | Generic Expo app | MessageAI-specific (10 features, 11 test files) |
| **Priorities** | No prioritization | 6 phases, 12 hours, clear priority levels |
| **Emulator Setup** | Mentioned | Complete Task 1.6b implementation guide |
| **Test Examples** | High-level | Full working code for each test type |
| **E2E Scenarios** | Generic | 7 specific scenarios from MVP Task List |
| **Coverage** | Mentioned | Gap analysis + path to 70%+ target |
| **Security** | Not mentioned | Firestore rules testing with examples |
| **Sequencing** | No dependencies | Phase 1 unblocks Phase 2, etc. |
| **Time Estimates** | None | 12 hours total, per-task estimates |

---

## Next Steps

1. **Review** this roadmap with team
2. **Schedule** 12-hour testing sprint (2-3 days)
3. **Start** with Phase 1 (Firebase Emulator setup)
4. **Track** progress in `memory_bank/06_active_context_progress.md`
5. **Update** this document as tests are completed

---

## Notes

- Testing was **intentionally deferred** during MVP development to ship faster
- Now we need to **backfill tests** before production
- Focus on **integration tests** over unit tests (more valuable for Firebase apps)
- **E2E tests** validate the critical user journeys that matter most
- **Don't aim for 100% coverage** - 70%+ with high-value tests is better than 90%+ with brittle tests

---

**Status**: Ready to execute  
**Owner**: Testing team  
**Timeline**: 12 hours (2-3 days)  
**Blocker**: None - all prerequisites met
