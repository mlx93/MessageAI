# Critical Bug Fixes - October 22, 2025 (Session 7 - Heartbeat & Core Fixes)

**Date:** October 22, 2025  
**Duration:** ~2 hours  
**Status:** ✅ All 4 Critical Bugs Fixed  
**Files Modified:** 4 files  
**Linter Errors:** 0 ✅

---

## 🎯 **Session Overview**

Fixed 4 critical bugs identified through user testing:
1. Messages not marked as read when received in active conversation
2. Double navigation causing stuck conversation screens
3. Old in-app banners appearing on app launch
4. Users showing "background" status indefinitely after force-quit

**Key Achievement:** Implemented proper heartbeat mechanism (15s interval) for accurate presence detection.

## 🐛 **Issue 1: Messages Not Marked as Read in Active Chat** ✅

### **Problem:**
When user is actively viewing a conversation:
- First batch of messages marked as read ✅
- New messages arrive while viewing → **NOT marked as read** ❌
- Return to Messages page → Shows unread count ❌

### **Root Cause:**
```typescript
// BROKEN LOGIC:
const hasMarkedRead = useRef(false);

if (!hasMarkedRead.current) {
  markMessagesAsRead(...);
  hasMarkedRead.current = true;  // ❌ STAYS TRUE FOREVER
}
```

The `hasMarkedRead` flag was designed to prevent duplicate marking, but it was set once and never reset. After marking the first batch, ALL future messages were ignored.

### **Solution:**
Removed the flag entirely. Philosophy: **"Being in the chat = messages are read"**

```typescript
// FIXED LOGIC:
// Simply mark ALL unread messages every time messages update
const unreadMessages = msgs.filter(m => 
  m.senderId !== user!.uid &&           // Not from me
  !m.readBy.includes(user!.uid)         // I haven't read it yet
);

if (unreadMessages.length > 0) {
  markMessagesAsRead(conversationId, user!.uid, unreadMessages.map(m => m.id));
  console.log(`✅ Marked ${unreadMessages.length} message(s) as read in active chat`);
}
```

**Key Insight:** Firestore is idempotent - marking the same message as read multiple times is safe and efficient.

### **Files Changed:**
- `app/chat/[id].tsx` - Removed `hasMarkedRead` ref, simplified marking logic

### **Impact:**
- ✅ All messages received while viewing chat are instantly marked as read
- ✅ No unread count on return to Messages page
- ✅ Matches user expectation: "If I'm looking at it, I've read it"

---

## 🐛 **Issue 2: Double Navigation During Active Messaging** ✅

### **Problem:**
When navigating from Messages page to conversation during active messaging:
- Sometimes pushed twice to navigation stack
- Resulted in: Messages page → Conversation → Conversation (duplicate)
- Required tapping back button twice to return

### **Root Cause:**
Optimistic state update happened BEFORE navigation, causing re-render during navigation transition. With active real-time updates from Firestore, this created race conditions.

### **Solution:**
Reordered operations to navigate FIRST, then update state:

```typescript
// BEFORE: State update before navigation
setConversations(...);  // Causes re-render
router.push(`/chat/${item.id}`);  // Navigation might trigger again during re-render

// AFTER: Navigate first, then update
setIsNavigating(true);
router.push(`/chat/${item.id}`);  // Navigate immediately

// Update state AFTER navigation starts (100ms delay)
setTimeout(() => {
  setConversations(...);  // No interference with navigation
}, 100);

// Increased guard timeout
setTimeout(() => setIsNavigating(false), 1500);  // Was 1000ms
```

**Additional Safeguards:**
1. Early return if already navigating: `if (isNavigating) return;`
2. Increased navigation guard from 1s to 1.5s
3. Delayed state update prevents re-render during navigation

### **Files Changed:**
- `app/(tabs)/index.tsx` - Reordered navigation logic, increased guard timeout

### **Impact:**
- ✅ Single navigation push every time
- ✅ Single back tap returns to Messages page
- ✅ No navigation stack corruption

---

## 🐛 **Issue 3: Old In-App Banners on Launch** ✅

### **Problem:**
When app launches, users see in-app notification banners for OLD messages:
```
📬 New message in SxP1hf1Hd8N8Mpe5jmsm from William Lewis, app state: active, active: null
📬 Message in different chat - showing in-app banner
```

These are messages from BEFORE the app was closed, not new messages.

### **Root Cause:**
Global message listener subscribes to last message in each conversation:
```typescript
subscribeToAllConversations(userId) {
  lastSeenMessageIds.clear();  // ❌ Forgets what we've seen
  
  // For each conversation...
  query(messages, orderBy('timestamp', 'desc'), limit(1))  // Gets last message
  
  onSnapshot((snapshot) => {
    if (messageChange.type === 'added') {  // ❌ OLD messages appear as "added"
      handleNewMessage(...);  // Shows banner
    }
  });
}
```

When Firestore listeners initialize, they emit existing documents as "added" events. Since `lastSeenMessageIds` was cleared, old messages appeared as "new".

### **Solution:**
Added 10-second recency filter:

```typescript
const handleNewMessage = async (...) => {
  // Skip if message is from current user
  if (message.senderId === currentUserId) return;
  
  // Skip if we've already seen this message
  if (lastSeenMessageIds.has(message.id)) return;
  
  // ✅ NEW: Only process messages < 10 seconds old
  const messageAge = Date.now() - message.timestamp.getTime();
  if (messageAge > 10000) {  // 10 seconds
    console.log(`📬 Skipping old message (${Math.floor(messageAge / 1000)}s old)`);
    lastSeenMessageIds.add(message.id);  // Mark as seen
    return;
  }
  
  // ... rest of notification logic
};
```

### **Behavior:**
- **Message age < 10s:** Show in-app banner (if in different chat) OR push notification (if backgrounded)
- **Message age > 10s:** Skip silently, mark as seen

### **Files Changed:**
- `services/globalMessageListener.ts` - Added recency check

### **Impact:**
- ✅ No more old message banners on app launch
- ✅ Only truly NEW messages trigger banners
- ✅ Clean app startup experience

## 🐛 **Issue 4: Heartbeat Mechanism + Accurate Offline Detection** ✅ ⭐ MAJOR

### **Problem:**
Users showed "background" (yellow indicator) indefinitely after force-quitting iOS app:
1. User actively using app → `online: true, inApp: true, lastSeen: T`
2. User force-quits → **NO CODE RUNS** (app terminated)
3. Firestore still has: `online: true, inApp: false, lastSeen: T`
4. After 2 minutes → Still showing "background" (yellow) to other users
5. Expected: Should show "offline" (no indicator) after ~30 seconds

### **Root Cause Analysis:**

**Missing Heartbeat:**
- `lastSeen` only updated on app state changes (login, foreground, background)
- No periodic updates while actively using app
- If user force-quits after 30s of activity → `lastSeen` could be 30s old
- 2-minute staleness check was too long

**No Offline Detection:**
- Force-quit = no code runs, can't set `online: false`
- Must rely on `lastSeen` timestamp staleness
- Previous threshold (2 min) was too long for good UX

### **Solution: 15-Second Heartbeat + 22s Staleness**

#### **A. Heartbeat Implementation**

Added to `AuthContext.tsx`:

```typescript
// Update lastSeen every 15 seconds while app is active
const startHeartbeat = (userId: string) => {
  heartbeatIntervalRef.current = setInterval(async () => {
    if (auth.currentUser) {
      await updateLastSeen(auth.currentUser.uid);
      console.log('💓 Heartbeat: Updated lastSeen');
    }
  }, 15000); // 15 seconds
  
  console.log('💓 Heartbeat: Started (15s interval)');
};

const stopHeartbeat = () => {
  if (heartbeatIntervalRef.current) {
    clearInterval(heartbeatIntervalRef.current);
    heartbeatIntervalRef.current = null;
    console.log('💔 Heartbeat: Stopped');
  }
};
```

**When Heartbeat Runs:**
- ✅ Started on login
- ✅ Resumed when app comes to foreground
- ✅ Stopped when app goes to background
- ✅ Stopped on logout
- ✅ Cleaned up on unmount

#### **B. Reduced Staleness Threshold**

Changed from 2 minutes (120s) to **22 seconds** (1.5x heartbeat interval):

```typescript
// In chat header and conversations list:
const secondsAgo = otherUserLastSeen 
  ? Math.floor((new Date().getTime() - otherUserLastSeen.getTime()) / 1000)
  : Infinity;
const isStale = secondsAgo >= 22;  // Was 120 seconds

if (otherUserOnline && otherUserInApp && !isStale) {
  subtitle = 'online';  // Green
} else if (otherUserOnline && !otherUserInApp && !isStale) {
  subtitle = 'background';  // Yellow
} else {
  subtitle = 'Last seen...';  // Offline
}
```

#### **C. How It Works**

**Normal Flow:**
1. User opens app → `online: true, inApp: true, lastSeen: now`
2. Heartbeat starts → Updates `lastSeen` every 15s
3. User backgrounds app → `inApp: false`, heartbeat stops
4. User returns → `inApp: true`, heartbeat resumes

**Force-Quit Flow:**
1. User opens app → Heartbeat running (updates every 15s)
2. User actively using for 30s → `lastSeen` updated twice (at 0s and 15s)
3. User force-quits at 30s → **NO CODE RUNS**
4. Firestore still has: `online: true, inApp: false, lastSeen: 30s`
5. After 22s (at 52s total) → Other users' staleness check triggers
6. Other users see: No indicator, "Last seen 1m ago"

**Why 15s heartbeat + 22s staleness?**
- **15s heartbeat** = Good balance of cost vs accuracy
- **22s staleness** = 1.5x heartbeat for reliable detection
- **Worst case:** User force-quits right after heartbeat → Detected in 37s
- **Best case:** User force-quits right before heartbeat → Detected in 22s
- **Average:** ~30 seconds (matches WhatsApp)

### **Cost Analysis**

**Firestore Writes:**
- 15s heartbeat = 4 writes/min = 240 writes/hour per active user
- 30s heartbeat = 2 writes/min = 120 writes/hour per active user
- 10s heartbeat = 6 writes/min = 360 writes/hour per active user

**For 100 active users (8 hours/day):**
- 15s: 192K writes/day (~$0.38/day at $0.002 per 1K writes)
- 30s: 96K writes/day (~$0.19/day)
- 10s: 288K writes/day (~$0.58/day)

15s is the sweet spot for MVP.

### **Files Changed:**
- `store/AuthContext.tsx` - Added heartbeat functions, lifecycle management
- `app/chat/[id].tsx` - Reduced staleness from 120s to 22s
- `app/(tabs)/index.tsx` - Reduced staleness from 120s to 22s

### **Impact:**
- ✅ Accurate presence detection within ~30 seconds of force-quit
- ✅ Green indicator = Actively using app (< 22s since last heartbeat)
- ✅ Yellow indicator = App in background but connected (< 22s)
- ✅ No indicator = Offline or force-quit (> 22s)
- ✅ Professional UX matching WhatsApp/iMessage

## 📊 **Presence Status Definitions** (Final)

| Status | Indicator | Text | Meaning | Conditions |
|--------|-----------|------|---------|------------|
| **Active** | 🟢 Green | "online" | Using app RIGHT NOW | `online: true, inApp: true, lastSeen < 22s` |
| **Background** | 🟡 Yellow | "background" | App running in background | `online: true, inApp: false, lastSeen < 22s` |
| **Offline** | None | "Last seen Xm ago" | App closed or > 22s inactive | `lastSeen >= 22s` OR `online: false` |

**Key Insight:** With heartbeat, `lastSeen` is always fresh (< 15s) for active users. The 22s threshold catches force-quits quickly.

## 💡 **Key Learnings**

### **1. Heartbeat is Essential for Presence**
Without periodic updates, `lastSeen` becomes stale during active use. Can't detect force-quit reliably without a heartbeat.

### **2. Idempotent Operations Don't Need Guards**
Removing `hasMarkedRead` flag simplified code and fixed the bug. Firestore handles duplicate writes efficiently.

### **3. Navigation Timing Matters**
State updates before navigation can cause re-renders that interfere with the navigation transition. Always navigate first, then update state.

### **4. Recency Filters Prevent Stale Data**
Firestore listeners emit existing data as "added" events. Always check timestamps to distinguish truly new data from initialization data.

### **5. Staleness Threshold = 1.5x Heartbeat**
Allows for one missed heartbeat plus network latency before marking offline. Good balance of responsiveness and reliability.
