**Created:** October 21, 2025  
**Priority:** High  
**Estimated Time:** 2-3 hours  
**Status:** Ready to start

## 📋 Session Context

Use this prompt to start the next session:

```
Hi! I'm working on MessageAI (aiMessage), a WhatsApp-style messaging app built with React Native (Expo), Firebase, and TypeScript.

IMPORTANT: Please read the memory bank first to get up to speed:
@memory_bank/ 

Key context:
- We just finished fixing critical phone auth bugs (session documented in memory_bank/09_oct21_final_session.md)
- Phone authentication is now working perfectly
- Conversation splitting is implemented and preserves history
- MVP is 100% feature complete with 229+ automated tests
- Current commits: 0ec4e3a (latest), 4b84f18, 4b15676

Current state:
- ✅ All 10 core MVP features working
- ✅ Phone + OTP auth fully functional
- ✅ Cloud Functions deployed to us-central1
- ✅ iMessage-quality UI with gestures
- ✅ Conversation splitting preserves history

NOW I need to fix 7 issues with the Contacts page and UI:

---

## 🐛 Issue 1: Chat Button Not Working on Contacts Page
**Location:** `app/(tabs)/contacts.tsx`
**Problem:** When I tap the "Chat" button next to a contact, nothing happens. It should launch a conversation with that user.
**Expected:** Tapping chat button should create/navigate to conversation with that contact
**Priority:** HIGH

---

## 🐛 Issue 2: Can't Add Searched Users to Contacts
**Location:** `app/(tabs)/contacts.tsx`
**Problem:** When I search for users in the search bar (which searches ALL app users), there's no way to add them to my contacts list. I can only see them.
**Expected:** Show an "Add to Contacts" button for searched users who aren't in my contacts yet
**Priority:** HIGH

---

## 🐛 Issue 3: "No Messages Yet" Showing for Conversations with History
**Location:** `app/(tabs)/index.tsx` (Messages page)
**Problem:** Some conversations show "No messages yet" even though they have message history. This happens with split conversations where the old 1-on-1 chat has 100 messages but shows as empty.
**Root Cause:** After conversation splitting, the old conversation's lastMessage might not be updated, or the check is failing
**Expected:** Show actual last message text or proper preview
**Priority:** MEDIUM

---

## 🐛 Issue 4: In-Group Search Bar Not Working on Android
**Location:** `app/chat/[id].tsx` (Add participant mode)
**Problem:** When in "Add participant" mode on Android, the search bar doesn't work properly. Keyboard doesn't appear or search doesn't trigger.
**Platform:** Android only (iOS works fine)
**Expected:** Search bar should work same as iOS
**Priority:** MEDIUM

---

## 🐛 Issue 5: Can Create Duplicate Conversations
**Location:** `services/conversationService.ts` + `app/new-message.tsx`
**Problem:** Users can create multiple conversations with the exact same participants. The app should recognize that a conversation already exists and navigate to it instead.
**Root Cause:** `createOrGetConversation()` might not be checking for existing conversations properly
**Expected:** Selecting same user(s) should navigate to existing conversation, not create duplicate
**Priority:** HIGH

---

## 🐛 Issue 6: UI Issues on New Message Screen
**Location:** `app/new-message.tsx`
**Problem A:** Header shows "tabs" in top right corner
**Problem B:** Message input bar at bottom is too low and cut off screen
**Expected:** 
- Clean header without "tabs" text
- Message input properly positioned within screen bounds
**Priority:** LOW (but easy fix)

---

## 🐛 Issue 7: Contacts Not Saving After Import
**Location:** `services/contactService.ts` + `app/(tabs)/contacts.tsx`
**Problem:** When I import contacts from my phone, they temporarily show in the list but don't persist. After closing and reopening the app, the contacts are gone.
**Root Cause:** Contacts might not be saved to Firestore, only kept in memory
**Expected:** Imported contacts should be saved to users/{uid}/contacts/ subcollection
**Priority:** HIGH

## 📁 Key Files to Check

### Contacts Related:
- `app/(tabs)/contacts.tsx` - Main contacts screen
- `services/contactService.ts` - Contact import and storage
- `app/contacts/import.tsx` - Import flow (if exists)

### Conversation Related:
- `services/conversationService.ts` - Conversation creation logic
- `app/(tabs)/index.tsx` - Messages list with last message display
- `app/chat/[id].tsx` - Chat screen with add participant mode
- `app/new-message.tsx` - New message composer

### Types:
- `types/index.ts` - Contact and Conversation interfaces

---

## 🎯 Success Criteria

After fixing all 7 issues:

1. ✅ Chat button on Contacts page opens conversation
2. ✅ Can add searched users to contacts with "Add" button
3. ✅ All conversations show proper last message (never "No messages yet" when history exists)
4. ✅ Android search bar in add participant mode works
5. ✅ Cannot create duplicate conversations - app navigates to existing one
6. ✅ New Message screen has clean header (no "tabs") and proper input positioning
7. ✅ Contacts persist after import and app restart

---

## 🔧 Implementation Strategy

**Suggested Order:**
1. Start with Issue 5 (duplicate conversations) - affects conversation creation logic
2. Fix Issue 1 (chat button) - depends on conversation creation working
3. Fix Issue 7 (contacts not saving) - core persistence issue
4. Fix Issue 2 (add searched users) - depends on contact saving working
5. Fix Issue 3 (last message display) - data display issue
6. Fix Issue 4 (Android search) - platform-specific debugging
7. Fix Issue 6 (UI issues) - quick cosmetic fixes

**Testing:**
- Test each fix immediately after implementation
- Use iOS Simulator AND Android Emulator (Pixel 9 Pro)
- Test conversation splitting to ensure Issue 3 is resolved
- Test contact import flow end-to-end

## 📊 Codebase Context

**Architecture:**
- File-based routing with Expo Router
- Firebase for backend (Auth, Firestore, Storage, Functions)
- Service layer pattern (authService, contactService, conversationService, etc.)
- Real-time listeners with Firestore onSnapshot
- SQLite for offline caching
- TypeScript throughout

**Key Patterns:**
- Deterministic conversation IDs for direct chats: `userId1_userId2` (sorted)
- UUID for group chats
- Phone numbers in E.164 format: `+18326559250`
- Display format: `(832) 655-9250`
- Contacts stored in `users/{uid}/contacts/` subcollection
- usersByPhone index for phone uniqueness

**Recent Changes:**
- Phone auth now creates usersByPhone index properly
- Conversation splitting preserves old conversations (doesn't archive)
- Profile setup uses merge writes to avoid permission errors
- complete-profile.tsx removed (use setup-profile.tsx only)
