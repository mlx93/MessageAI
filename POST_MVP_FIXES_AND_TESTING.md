# Post-MVP Implementation - Fixes & Testing Guide

**Date:** October 23, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ All features implemented and bugs fixed

---

## 🐛 **Bug Fixes Applied**

### **1. Missing Back Buttons** ✅ FIXED
**Issue:** Group Info and Contact Info screens had no back buttons

**Solution:**
- Added `Stack.Screen` components to both screens
- Set proper title and `headerBackTitle: ''` for clean arrow-only back button
- Files updated: `app/group/[id].tsx`, `app/contact/[userId].tsx`

### **2. Navigation Error on "Send Message"** ✅ FIXED
**Issue:** Tapping "Send Message" from Contact Info crashed with conversationService error

**Root Cause:** `NodeJS.Timeout` type not available in React Native environment

**Solution:**
- Changed timer type from `NodeJS.Timeout` to `ReturnType<typeof setTimeout>`
- This is the correct cross-platform way to type timers
- File updated: `services/conversationService.ts`

### **3. Navigation Flow** ✅ IMPROVED
**Issue:** After creating conversation, navigation was unclear

**Solution:**
- Changed `router.push` to `router.replace` in Contact Info
- This prevents back button from returning to Contact Info after chat opens
- Cleaner UX flow: Contact Info → Chat (no way to go back to Contact Info)
